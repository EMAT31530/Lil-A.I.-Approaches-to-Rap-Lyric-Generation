Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your mother fucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying, cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9 6

Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, a zany actin maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twisting necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist 'em up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hits the snare and bass in a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring, gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it servin a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite 
defense
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil bands
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand a lonely one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
That eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it servin a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M O
So I'm assuming all responsibility
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic Nestler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather led a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cammy on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite

You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it servin a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it servin a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

95...96...and on and on....

Eye Kyu: Check it out, 
Eminem: Hey Kyu

Eye Kyu:
I'm up all night, but everything is alright  It's alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep  I can't sleep
It's a long year pretending I belong here  Belong here
It's a broke day but everything is ok  It's ok
I'm up all night, but everything is alright  It's alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep  I can't sleep
It's a long year pretending I belong here  Belong here

One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
Till I'm glad to be buried 
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q

Eye Kyu:
I'm up all night, but everything is alright  It's alright

I'm up all night, but everything is alright  It's alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep  I can't sleep
It's a long year pretending I belong here  Belong here

I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep 
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grant's and Jackson's
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity 
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool 
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

Eye Kyu:
I'm up all night, but everything is alright  It's alright

I'm up all night, but everything is alright  It's alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep  I can't sleep
It's a long year pretending I belong here  Belong here

Uh, it's ok, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep
Uh yeah, it's ok, it's alright, I can't sleep

Eye Kyu: Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Eminem: Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right 
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming bitch
We elevated to new heights premeditated 
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show so
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho now
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate 
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance 
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip hop 
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know

So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Eye Kyu: Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack 

So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me
So you ain't ever gonna be one see
Eminem: So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills that you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me
So you ain't ever gonna be one see

Women singing
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight

I'm givin mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
Druggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
The mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit
The tall shit that'l end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat shit
Butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it
Baby all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you 
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight  blends in with lyrics

Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Aiyyo, biters are like tarantulas, vandealous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
I think a living never meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread interamentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
Talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back
Come to battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it

Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight  blends in with lyrics

Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Eminem is heading skyward
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece 
of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous 
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
I meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you adding fuel to the fire
I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchanting, with the romantic
Freaking the vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like

Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight  blends in with lyrics

Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright 

Maxine Phone Rings

Maxine: Hello
Denaun: Can I speak to Maxine
Maxine: Yeah this is me what's up
Denaun: What up
Maxine: Who dis
Denaun: Denaun 
Maxine: Yeah what's up
Denaun: What are you doing
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Huh
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Why
Maxine: I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do

I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you step away son, she got her face done
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it  Maxine

Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose In life that is
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night
You say it's gonna stop but it..  just.. slows.. down
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this 
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hiding in your closet
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely

I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas 
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said Hey Bitch..
Haven't I seen you before, looked at my nigga
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
And said Oh it's like that
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine two
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
I said Maxine check this out, 
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out
Got to the crib she let me in
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
I said Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things
What the fuck are you doing
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
Before I hit it she said
3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass
I said What is it, another nigga  It's ok
She said No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS
I got up out

Denaun: Hey, Maxine
Maxine: What
Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick
Maxine: Yeah for a small price
Denaun: For a small price What you mean
Maxine: You know, money nigga
Denaun: You don't need no damn money, 
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.
Maxine: laughing What you, what you hear I got
Denaun: AIDS
Maxine: laughing Who told you that bullshit
Denaun: My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Maxine: Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Denaun: Oh for real, it's like that
Maxine: laughing Well I ain't got shit, 
so he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me, 
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga
Denaun: Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you
Maxine: No, see.. 
Denaun: You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Maxine: Hold on, why it ain't even like that
Denaun: I want ya'll to get paid, fucking..
Maxine: laughing as the phone hangs up

Hey what up man
What up god
Ya heard
Chillen, cold as hell
Yes it is, hey Busta didn't come here did he
No, hey look, you got fifteen cent
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store alright man quick cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store
Nah, look..
You should just, how much you got there
I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar know what I mean..
Just throw it in there they ain't gonna know
You know what look, I'm sick of taking this damn bus everywhere man
You gotta make some moves or something
I know look, I'm trying to get rich, 
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car, 
you know what I'm saying
I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Look hey, we gotta make some hit records or something, 
you know what I'm saying  Cause I'm tired of being broke

Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of having a turn to earn money to burn
Mapping out my strategies to get rich huh
My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh
Cause man I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothing's different to me, so what, it's easy to see
I'll be the prisoner to flee, all of this misery
I'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me, but if you disagree
You missing the key, you ain't even in the brisk of the tea
Unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a mission less course
When shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star

No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh

You know what I'm saying, see what I'm talking about man 
Cause that's it
Yeah 
A million dollars ain't even that far away man
Yo we got to get the money man, I can't be broke for the rest of my life
Yeah I hear what your saying, 
look there's got to be something better, you know what I'm saying
I can't live like this for the rest of my life man, 
bumming rides everywhere I go
Yeah, what's up with Lexus' and Land cruisers'

Yo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business
I'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just choose
The few that I trust, thems the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta fill pot, get your grill shot
The 5 Elemantz for life my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through into time
My crews true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man planning what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star

No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh

That's what I'm talking about, I'm not trying to be the player, 
I'm trying to be the man, I'm want to be President
Yo forgot that President man I'm trying to be king, 
making dead presidents, you know what I'm saying
Yeah
Getting money anytime I want owning my own businesses and all that, 
you know what I'm saying
Yeah, I'm trying to be a millionare man, hahaha, but don't all you know
You only live once 
ninety six baby 

Women Singing:
Ain't no one special, special like you 4X
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby 4X

I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
Missing what I remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing
Bugging and weezing, I'm having trouble when breathing
It's even tougher when sleeping
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving
For loving and leaving, you all I'm thinking of in the evening
You got my knees buckling and weakening
Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speaking
I got some game that I'm preparing to run
The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun
I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a 
touch 
I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good
The seed is passing in dust
I'm not asking to rush and answer immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me, I Love You I love you baby
Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to be
Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found

Women Singing:
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby 4X

Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things
I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
It's still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear
You look impeccable, nothing compares
I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
When you step away, baby but don't forget the Neglicie

Women Singing:
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby 8X
Ain't no one special, special like you 2X

Men singing:
Jealous 8X

Girls voice: Talking over the singing
Jealous  What he mean jealous, know what I'm saying
He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying
Girls don't buy him no clothes, He bought that ho some clothes
He don't buy me no clothes, Nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, What do I got to be jealous for
He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean...

I come home every single day from working double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
To many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
So what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company now you always bugging me 
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check them in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What

Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy 8X

Women's Voice: Talking over singing
Fuck you and what you going through
Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
Immature, Me  Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
Know what I'm saying  He just mad cause I'm getting it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying  That's what I'm talking about
Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy

I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
Until the day I started following your feetprints
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense, there's someone else you like 
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike
Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
He goes, You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now
Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down
You run me down and now your trying to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...

Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy 12X

Warning, this shit's gon be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, Bitch you got a sick kid
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
Murder Murder Redrum
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from
Inebriated, till my stress is eleviated
How in the fuck can Eminem and shady be related
Illiterate, illigitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out Ahhhh killed the bitch and did her
Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was little'er
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fuckin Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler
Didn't Ya  Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

E I'm low down and I'm shiftee
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
and ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from..

I lace tunes, I'm out this world like Space Moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippits
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
Losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio hazard causing wreckage
Smoked out like Eckridge
Band just making my neck itch
What the fuck Gimme the tech bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap hips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen's really dust smoking
If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in

My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got my swinging
Bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent, toking microphones with Broken English
Make your mama be like Ohh This is good Who sing this
Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit.
It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic
Living off liquid Triametic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anasin
Frozen Manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for and IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon come is Tupac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Setup by these white blue collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks

Life.. by Marshall Mathers
What is life
Life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
And everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies, with secret indentities
and disguises, to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin
What is money
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
What is life
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off
I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on Nobody's As Ill As Me
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of J L B saying Where Hip Hop Lives

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm saying
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive
Know what I'm sayin
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin  Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin
Just fed up
That's my word

Whoah
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
and like, back and forth because ah
this is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open
I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic Hi Marshall
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson 
The  Proof  is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two glocks 
Screamin _Fuck the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials Bye bye
Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

Somebody let me out this limousine hey, let me out
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

Hey, fuck that
Outsidaz..
Pace One..
Young Zee..

Just the two of us.. 8X

Eminem
Baby your da da loves you hey
And I'ma always be here for you hey no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama  She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell whew da da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin   it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da da's toy knife, honey, let go of it no
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful
Don't you wanna help da da build a sand castle yeah
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch   it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she  We'll let her wash off in the water

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya  Nah
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out WAHH
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba ba 
Take a night night  Nan a boo, goo goo ga ga
Her make goo goo ca ca  Da da change your dia dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty nighty

Ninety seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear ma maa
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da da tie a rope around this rock  yeah
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE  whoooooshhhhh
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step da da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye bye, tell mama you love her mommy

Bizarre
Yeah...ha ha ha BANG, Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you
Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha

No one's iller than me wha
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313...

Swift
I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meanin' 
Got your whole crew doing subpeonas
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadrapalegics outta these non rappin rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret
That your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like Two Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW

It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh

Bizarre
Me and Eminem and Mike
Drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
Cuz he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route 
Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell EVERYBODY GET OUT
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2 piece
Cuz she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10 year old niece

No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

Eminem
Nobody better test me, cuz I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40 bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8 ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
Furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters

Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

Fuzz
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads
Flashin' bread, roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK
And got drop kicked, now she screamin' Stop it...
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick
Sick a ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggaz still don't know the top pick
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks bitch
We rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits
No one...

Ain't nobody iller than me

Bizzare
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz arre from the 313

You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast...

All I see is murder murder, my mind state  > 2Pac
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate  > Swift
All I see is murder murder, my mind state  > 2Pac
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill

Eminem
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
the shit is in my hands, here's yo' life span
And for what yo' life's worth; this money is twice than
You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin, clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
or gets ya description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed, the best thing
would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin Freeze
But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin a vest

Eminem
Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out
We were backin out this lady's Jag started blackin out
Pulled the Mac 10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut ya yakkin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
like the girl on Set it Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin: Son, go in and call the police
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
And collided with an 80 year old lady with groceries
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must a dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin TRUCE TRUCE
Don't shoot Surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me  It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnapps

CHORUS scratches to fade out

Eminem
Yeah, don't do drugs

Hi  My name is.. what  My name is.. who
Hi  My name is.. huh  My name is.. what

Ahem.. excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class 
for one second

Eminem
Hi kids  Do you like violence  Yeah yeah yeah
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids  Uh huh
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did  Yeah yeah
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is  Huh
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight
but I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate  Ummmm..
And Dr. Dre said, Slim Shady you a basehead
Uh uhhh  So why's your face red  Man you wasted
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut  Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

Eminem
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of papers  Owwwwwwww
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin over pedestrians
in a spaceship while they screamin at me: LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS
Ninety nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do  Damn
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her  Oh thank you
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans  Aaahhhhhh
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
Dude, can I get your autograph
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE'

Eminem
Stop the tape  This kid needs to be locked away  Get him
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die  Fuck that
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Huh yup  Am I comin or goin  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka    dare me to drive  Go ahead
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
Whoops  Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk  hachhh too
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks  C'mere
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM  WAH
YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS  WAHHH
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
Put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head  BANG
I'm steamin mad  Arrrggghhh 
And by the way when you see my dad  Yeah
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

Meet Eddie, twenty three years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
he decides to rob a liquor store.
I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play...
Shit is mine, I gotta do this.. gotta do this

Dr. Dre
Alright, stop  Huh
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence  But who are you
I'm your motherfuckin conscience

Eminem
That's nonsense
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay 
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with an aged razor blade

Dr. Dre
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns

Eminem
Fuck that  Do that shit  Shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit  Are you that rich
Why you give a fuck if she dies  Are you that bitch
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids

Dr. Dre
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it  You're right
Not over this shit  Stop Drop the biscuit  I will
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
You know what Dre  I don't like your attitude..

It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute
Mmm, I don't know
Look baby..
Damn
Yo, it's gonna be alright, right
Well OK..

announcer
Meet Stan, twenty one years old.  Give me a kiss
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play...  Shit

Eminem
Now listen to me, while you're kissin her cheek
and smearin her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe..
Yo  This girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair
Yo, look at her bush.. does it got hair  Uh huh
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie _Kids_
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail..

announcer
Meet Grady, a twenty nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
he walks in the door of his trailer park home
to find his wife in bed with another man.
WHAT THE FUCK
Grady

Dr. Dre
Alright calm down, relax, start breathin..

Eminem
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin
While you at work she's with some dude tryin to get off
FUCK slittin her throat, CUT THIS BITCH'S HEAD OFF

Dr. Dre
Wait  What if there's an explanation for this shit
What  She tripped  Fell  Landed on his dick
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

Eminem
Okay  Thought about it, still wanna stab her
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped DEE BARNES

Dr. Dre
What'chu say  What's wrong   Didn't think I'd remember
I'ma kill you motherfucker

Eminem
Uhhh aahh  Temper temper
Mr. Dre  Mr. N.W.A.
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent

Dr. Dre
Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that.. aw fuck it...
What am I sayin  Shoot em both Grady, where's your gun at  

Doctor Scalpel
Nurse  Here
Doctor Sponge
Nurse  Here
Doctor Wait.. he's convulsing, he's convulsing
Nurse  Ah
Doctor We're gonna have to shock him
Nurse  Oh my  Oh my God
Doctor We're gonna have to shock him
Nurse  Oh my God

Eminem
These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts, Nurse we're losin him, check the pulse
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny lookin white boy, scrawny and always ornery
Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
Whosssssh  My first day in junior high, this kid said,
It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die
I looked at my watch it was one twenty
I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me
He said, Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse...
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Something told me, Try to fake a stomach ache it works
I screamed, Owww  My appendix feels like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse
N What's the matter
E I don't know, my leg, it hurts
N Leg  I thought you said it was your tummy
E Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee
N Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over.
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework.
E But don't you wanna give me after school detention
N Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him.

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin
But everywhere I go they keep playin my song

Eminem
Brain damage..
Way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose,
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him, We shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, You gonna die honkey
The principal walked in  What's going on in here
and started helpin him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice,
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.
I'm gettin you back bully  Now once and for good.
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
and beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot..
.. Made it home, later that same day
Started reading a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin to read
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin, What are you on, drugs
Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug  Sorry
She beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, Look bitch, what have you done
M Oh my God, I'm sorry son
E Shut up you cunt  I said, Fuck it
Took it and stuck it back up in my head
then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

Eminem
Brain damage..
It's brain damage..
I got brain damage..
It's brain damage..
It's probably brain damage..
It's brain damage..
Brain damage..
I got brain damage..

Life.. by Marshall Mathers
What is life
Life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
And everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies, with secret indentities
and disguises, to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin
What is money
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
What is life
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off
I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on Nobody's As Ill As Me
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of J L B saying Where Hip Hop Lives

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm saying
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive
Know what I'm sayin
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin  Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin
Just fed up
That's my word

If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da da will be right there
Your da da loves you

OK, I'm going to attempt to drown myself 
You can try this at home 
You can be just like me

Mic check one two.. we recordin 
I'm cancerous, so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangled you to death then I choked you again
Then break your fuckin legs till your bones poke through your skin
You beef wit me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat yer ass legally
I get you blunted off of funny home grown
Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
Ohh no  So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie AND get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet Bitch
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads Fuck you
Every girl I ever went out wit is goin lez
Follow me and do exactly what the song says:
smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink
And jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white, I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave

Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold'
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco we did it
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray an Aerosol can up at the ozone layer psssssssh
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin out the morgue
witcha dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon wit a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother.. are you there  I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed
a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain
I take a breather and sighed; either I'm high, or I'm nuts
Cause if you ain't tiltin this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass 
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I've been with 10 women who got HIV
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me

G Eminem as Susan the girl

Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault

Eminem
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan    an ex heroin addict who just stopped usin
who love booze and alternative music Whattup
Told me she was goin back into usin again Nah
I said, Wait, first try this hallucinogen

Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
She said,
G Help me I think I'm havin a seisure
I said, I'm high too bitch, quit grabbin my t shirt  Let go
Would you calm down you're startin to scare me
She said,

I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
Hello I'm over here Sue, hi you're talkin to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late 
Cause I never seen no one eat as many shrooms as you ate

and It was an accident at the end

Susan wait  Where you goin  You better be careful
G Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue
Want some gum  Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please
I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these
John, where's Dave at before I bash you
J He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude
Dave  Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants
choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left 
of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off
D Well it depends on how may you had
I took three, she ate the other twenty two caps
Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, drinkin Lysol
D She's gonna die dude
I know and it's my fault
D My god

and What do I do at the end

My God, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry  Susan please wake up

Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
I can't stand white people
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
I'm in the fourth row, signin autographs at your show
Yo can you sign this right here
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
cause I don't even remember the words to my shit umm, one two
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You wanna get high, here bitch just sniff this

Cum on everybody get down tonight

Eminem
Yo.. yo yo yo yo
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
and I was wavin it at everybody screamin, I suck  I SUCK
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
and yell out loud, All y'all get the hell out now
Fuck rap, I'm givin it up y'all, I'm sorry
But Eminem this is your record release party
I'm bored out of my gourd    so I took a hammer 
and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard
who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket I ain't got it all
One Excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
ohhhhhhh  And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

Cum on everybody get down tonight

Eminem
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
So I told em I was Mike D
They was like, Gee I don't know, he might be
I told em, Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
I'll be standin by the Loch Ness Monster okay peace out bye
Then I jetted to the weed house
Smoked out til I started bustin freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept
I wanna make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

Cum on everybody get down tonight

Aiyyo  
This song is dedicated   to all the happy people
All the happy people   who have real nice lives
And who have no idea what it's like, to be broke as fuck

I feel like I'm walkin a tight rope, without a circus net
Poppin percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect; but I work and sweat for this worthless check
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
and my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin ballers while they flossin in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin autograph signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fry's and average half pinters
But playa haters turnin bitch like they have vaginas
Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
when snakes slither in the grass spineless

That's Rock Bottom   when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's Rock Bottom   when you want somethin bad enough to steal
That's Rock Bottom   when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin things look up; but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin dead end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play
Cause when we die we know we all going the same way
Cause it's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
I'm comfortable and roomy in a six
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of sess a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

There's people that love me, and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbin deceitful and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
if it means I end up burnin in hell scorchin in flames
if it means I'm stealin your checkbook and forgin your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
Cause right now, I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I got problems   now everybody on my blocks got 'em
I'm screamin like them two cops when Tupac shot 'em
Holdin two glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you wearin look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flauntin 'em I could be takin 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch, you want 'em
Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

Whoah
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
and like, back and forth because ah
this is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open
I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic Hi Marshall
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson 
The  Proof  is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two glocks 
Screamin _Fuck the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials Bye bye
Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

Somebody let me out this limousine hey, let me out
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

Hey, fuck that
Outsidaz..
Pace One..
Young Zee..

I dont know why this world keep turning
Round and Round
But I wish it would stop, and let me off right now

Yes man
As the World Turns
We all experience things in life
Trials and Tribulations
That we all must go through
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience

Eminem
I hang with a bunch of hippies
and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches
and light up like jack o lanterns
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
They never should've booted me out of reform school
Deformed fool,takin a shit in a warm pool
They threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin Oh my god its you Not again
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cuz I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin teachers, and jackin off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed
May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast Who Me
Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin RARRRR
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that bitch by her hair
Drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop

As the World Turns
These are the days of our lives
These are the things that we must go through
Day by day

Eminem
We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage
Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
I met a slut and said What up, its nice to meet ya
I'd like to treat ya to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt
But I aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money
And don't try nothin funny
Cuz you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to outrun me
I went to grab my gun
Thats when her ass put it on me
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors
Started causin a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god I was smokin crack all day
And doped up off coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her
But so I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in
And shot her fuckin porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
Thats when I seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now
She said Come in, its unlocked
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay porn
She said Come her big boy, lets get acquainted
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg No, please let go
But she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Den Den Den Den Den Den, Go go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out, and aint no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted Now bitch, lets see who gets the best
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death Ahh Ahhh
Come here bitch
Come here
Take this motherfuckin dick
Bitch, come here

And as we go along
Throughout the days of our lives
We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
That we must go through
These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere
Every day
Every single day the world keeps turning

Eminem
Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough huh
Told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl I did
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, Fuck the world
I'm Slim Shady.. so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty five times in the same spot Ow
I think I got a generation brainwashed
to pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot uhh oh
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop gulp gulp
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a minithin
I'm Slim Shady.. I'm Shady

Eminem
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful uh huh huh
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful hehehe
like when my teacher sucked my wee wee in preschool Woo
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
while I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like
cause this is how I am in real life mm hmm
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice uh huh
How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
when they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet Huh
So bring the money by tonight   cause your wife 
said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life Help me Help me
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school Stay in school
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a minithin
I'm Slim Shady.. I'm Shady

Eminem
Yo.. I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it 
Aww that shit is wack
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit 
What That's my shit
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit Yup, uh huh
But they love it when you make your business public
so fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject uh huh
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it
cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack uh uhh don't do coke, I do smoke weed uh huh
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer yup
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead uh uhh she's still alive and bitchin yup
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a minithin
I'm Slim Shady.. I'm Shady
Ha hah ha, ha  Ha hah, hah.. I told you I was Shady
Ha hah ha, hah ha  Ha hah, hah ha, hah ha, hah ha
Y'all didn't wanna believe me
I'm Shady
.. And that's my name

Cowboy
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop em
Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold blood
That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da Five Nine

Eminem
I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a sismograph
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head AAHHH
Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed
Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said

Royce
Who hard yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil
Intelligence level is hell ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
And stay over worked, its like the Nazis in the nations
Collaborating, attemptin to take over the earth

Eminem
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either shit, me neither
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three amounts
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
He's insane No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cuz I can't find a decent vain

Royce
The disaster wit dreds
I'm Bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cuz I serve any stranger wit money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you
Whippin human ass, throwin blows crackin jaws 
Wit my fists wrapped in gause, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's
Somehow MC's ain't that eye brow raisin to me
>From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche
And bust till volcanoes errupt

interlude
Hello Billy Aiyyo what's up we're comin to get you
STOP, THEY KNOW IT'S US

Eminem
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me uh ah
I'm the one who burned your house down oh
Well I'm out now shit, and this time I'm comin back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

Royce Eminem
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel
We'll be waitin See you in hell
Wall Street, Royce Da Five Nine, Slim Shady
See you in hell for the sequel bye bye
Bad Meets Evil, what till next time

Cowboy
And so that's the story when Bad Meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin out of that ol' saloon
But their spirits still live on till this day
Shhh...spits wait, did y'all hear that
Footsteps and windblowing

Eminem
A lot of people ask me.. am I afraid of death..
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think.. that I worship the devil..
that I do all types of.. retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you  Good
Cause I still don't give a fuck

I'm zonin off of one joint, stoppin a limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, bodypierce with this
Livin amuk, never givin a fuck
Gimme the keys I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re open your scab YEAH
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud
I've calmed down now    I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin this rhyme
Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time

For all the weed that I've smoked   yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended   yeah fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have   yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can KISS MY ASS
For all the drugs that I've done   yo I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended   yeah fuck you too
For everytime I reminisce   yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can KISS MY ASS

Eminem
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin another bomb 
Cause I'm crushin the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron on
And the pants to match Here momma try em on
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives,
a brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
Shittin on rappers  Causin hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again 

Eminem
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spend a million a track and went over my budget Ohh shit
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt
I can't rap anymore   I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women   fuck bitches 
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a click   I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me 
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place 
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded  What did that nurse say  Brain damage
Fuck, I was born during the earthquake

Announcer This is ANOTHER public service announcement
brought to you, in part, by Slim Shady
Eminem Tell 'em I don't give a fuck...
Announcer Slim Shady does not give a FUCK, what you think
Eminem Tell 'em to suck it....
Announcer If you don't like it, you can suck his fucking cock
Eminem: Tell 'em they kissed my ass....
Announcer Little did you know, upon purchasing this album
you have just kissed his ass
Eminem Tell 'em I'm fed up...
Announcer Slim Shady is fed up with your shit
and he's going to kill you
Eminem Yeah
Announcer Uh, anything else
Eminem Yeah, SUE ME

Eminem
When I just a little baby boy,
my momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
she used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
and I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin I could do or say to try to change it
cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
AHHH Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more
AHHH These motherfuckers are thinkin I'm playin
Thinkin I'm sayin the shit cause I'm thinkin it just to be sayin it
AHHH Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull  YOU  to this bullet, and put it through you
AHHH Shut up slut, you're causin too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma
Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,
snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover
You god damn right BITCH, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
danglin from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'ma kill you  You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither   you ain't nuttin but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you  You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin I don't squash the beef
You better kill me  I'ma be another rapper dead
for poppin off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said
But when they kill me   I'm bringin the world with me
Bitches too  You ain't nuttin but a girl to me
.. I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady cause why
Cause Shady, will fuckin kill you ah haha
I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady why
Cause Shady, will fuckin kill you..

Eminem
Bitch I'ma kill you  Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
in a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryin to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't acid rap, but I rap on acid
Got a new blow up doll and just had a strap on added
WHOOPS  Is that a subliminal hint  NO
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend  NO  Eminem insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
to do it again, THEN, if he does it again
you'll probably end up jumpin out of somethin up on the 10th
Ahhhhhhhh Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
in a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman
Serial killer hidin murder material
in a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Eminem
Eh heh, know why I say these things
Cause lady's screams keep creepin in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
this eighty G's a week to say the same things TWEECE
TWICE  Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots  I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink
FUCK THAT  I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
from fat bitch to off seventy thousand pounds of her
from principal to the student body and counselor
from in school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin I'm leavin air in your lungs
just to hear you keep screamin for me to seep it
OKAY, I'M READY TO GO PLAY
I GOT THE MACHETE FROM O.J.
I'M READY TO MAKE EVERYONE'S THROATS ACHE
You faggots keep eggin me on
til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop
SHUT UP  Give me your hands and feet
I said SHUT UP when I'm talkin to you
YOU HEAR ME  ANSWER ME

ninth line starts Bitch I'ma kill you

Eminem
Hahaha, I'm just playin ladies
You know I love you

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..

Eminem as 'Stan'
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up  Man how's your daughter
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

Eminem as 'Stan'
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad   I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
four hours and you just said, No.
That's pretty shitty man   you're like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver   you said if I'd write you
you would write back   see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan    P.S.
We should be together too

Eminem as 'Stan'
Dear Mister I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans,
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word   I don't deserve it
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive
You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late   I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped  ALL  of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out

Eminem
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
I say that shit just clownin dogg,
c'mon   how fucked up is you
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad  Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
Damn

I never knew I..
I never knew I..
Mic check one two
I never knew I..
Who woulda knew
I never knew I..
Who'da known
I never knew I..
Fuck would've thought
I never knew I..
Motherfucker comes out
I never knew I..
and sells a couple of million records
I never knew I..
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
I never knew I..

Eminem
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put wives at risk with a knife like this AHHH
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin to straight jump out
put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now
Oh   you want me to watch my mouth, how
Take my fuckin eyeballs out, and turn em around
Look   I'll burn your fuckin house down, circle around
and hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out
Oh my God Oh my God I'm sorry, there must be a mix up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
The kids But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin him   apparently you ain't parents

Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

Eminem
So who's bringin the guns in this country  Hmm
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen a Schwarzaneggar movie
where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row,
screamin Go, with their 17 year old Uncle
I'm like, Guidance   ain't they got the same moms and dads
who got mad when I asked if they liked violence
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make up you allow your 12 year old daughter to wear
Hmm  So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
when his bus driver's screamin at him, fuckin him up worse
Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin prick
And fuck was the first word I ever learned
up in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird Look
So read up, about how I used to get beat up
peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every 3 months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like what
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night, Ike
So how much easier would life be
if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me

Eminem
I never knew I.. knew I'd..
have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby de doo wop what
Skibbedy be bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin some trees HEY
How many retards'll listen to me
and run up in the school shootin when they're pissed at a
teach er, her, him, is it you is it them
Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again
Damn  How much damage can you do with a pen
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
if you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought
that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it   I ain't know if you'd do it or not

Eminem
How the fuck was I supposed to know

Eminem
Whatever..
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fuck it 
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest MC on this    on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and I rest again peacefully peacefully..
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 
in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me speak to me..
I don't know you and no, 
I don't owe you a mo therfuck in thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty..
No patience is in me and if you offend me 
I'm liftin you 10 feet liftin you 10 feet.. in the air 
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you of all you..
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

Eminem
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
And, Oh, it's his lyrical content  
the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me finger at me..
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on Marilyn on Marilyn.. and the heroin
Where were the parents at  And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci ty
havin this happenin this happenin..
then attack Eminem cause I rap this way rap this way..
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire 
to burn and it's burnin and I have returned

Eminem
I'm so sick and tired of bein admired
that I wish that I would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on My Name is..
And pigeon holed into some pop py sensation
to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience got the patience..
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk 
with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin 
the same fuckin questions fuckin questions..
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out
cause they drivin me crazy drivin me crazy.. I can't take it 
I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for ev ery fan that I get
But I can't take a SHIT, in the bathroom
without someone standin by it
No I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

Eminem
May I have your attention please
May I have your attention please
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up
We're gonna have a problem here..

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin her ass worse than before
they first were divorce, throwin her over furniture Ahh
It's the return of the... Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding, 
he didn't just say what I think he did, did he
And Dr. Dre said... nothing you idiots 
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement Ha ha
Look at him, walkin around grabbin his you know what
Flippin the you know who,  Yeah, but he's so cute though
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel don't they
We ain't nothing but mammals.. Well, some of us cannibals
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up

Eminem
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records;
well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird
Why  So you guys could just lie to get me here
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
You little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee hee
I should download her audio on MP3 
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
And there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing but not quite me

Eminem
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin you 
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
in front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it 
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
It's funny; cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin home flirting
Pinchin nurses asses when I'm jackin off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin
He could be workin at Burger King, spittin on your onion rings
Screaming I don't give a fuck 
with his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go

Eminem
Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up

RBX
Remember me Seven executions
Remember me I have no remorse
Remember me I'm 'High Powered'
Remember me I drop bombs like Hiroshima

For this one it's the X, you retarded
Cause I grab the mic and get DOWN, like Syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses, without boundaries
which qualifies me for the term universal
Without no rehearsal, I leak words that's controversial
Like I'm not, the one you wanna contest, see
cause I'll hit yo' ass like the train did that bitch 
that got Banned From TV    heavyweight hitter
Hit you watch your whole head split up
Loco is the motion, we comin through
Hollow tips is the lead, the .45 threw

Sticky Fingaz
Remember me Throw ya gunz in the air
Remember me Slam  Slam
Remember me Nigga 'Bacdafucup'
Remember me Chka chka Onyx

Niggaz that take no for an answer, get told no
Yeah I been told no but it was more like, No, no, no
Life a bitch that'll fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
this vet is ahead of, the shit is all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead a the cheddar's incredda'
Settle vendetta with metal beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence  NOPE  Never leave a shred of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My moms got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga  PBBT  You better dead that shit
My name should be Can't Believe That Nigga Said That Shit
Probably sayin, He ain't a killer, but I'm killin myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw, on the kitchen floor
So think what I'ma do to you, have done to you
Got niggaz in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do, cocksuckers  We glock busters
'Til the cops cuff us, we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
'Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm gettin wires niggaz wantin me dead, wantin my head

Eminem
Remember me I just don't give a fuck
Remember me Yeah, fuck you too
Remember me I'm low down and I'm shifty
Remember me I'm Shady

When I go out, I'ma go out shootin
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid
I'm tryin to clear up my fuckin' image, 
so I promised the fuckin critics
I wouldn't say fuckin for six minutes
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin these crazy thoughts
in my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on
Came home, and somebody musta broke in the back window
and stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick sick dreams of picnic scenes, two kids, sixteen
with M 16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets
FUCK THAT  PBBT  You faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
and re appear in hell with a can of gas, AND a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at
What the fuck you starin at, nigga

Don't you remember me
Remember me
Remember me
REMEMBER ME

That's why they call me Slim Shady I'm Back 
I'm Back I'm Back SLIM SHADY I'm Back

Eminem
I murder a rhyme one word at a time
You never, heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better, get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself
I'm waitin for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was puttin shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to, get punked and bullied on my block
'til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
What do I think of suc cess  It sucks, too much press I'm stressed
Too much stares two breasts, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick yes
Grew up quick no was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say, Hi
Became a commodity because I'm W H I 
T E, cuz MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now is it worth it  Look at my life, how is it perfect
Read my lips bitch, what, my mouth isn't workin
You hear this finger  Oh it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

Eminem
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe 
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the, internet
Tryin to, lure your kids with him, into bed
It's a, sick world we live in these days
Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it
Mind with no sense in it, fried to get so frenetic
whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smokin 'em
with my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doin lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hoppin out 
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me

Eminem
I take seven kids from Columbine, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK 47, a revolver, a nine
a Mack 11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
Cause I'mmmm Shady, they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing
Am I the only one who realizes they stink
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring AHHHH
So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that I was stickin it to Christina
Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
it'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
and have a son and a new brother at the same time
and just say that it ain't mine, what's my name

Guess who's b back, back
Gue gue guess who's back Hi mom
Gue, gue gue gue, guess who's back
Slim Shady, 2001

Eminem
You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em somethin
Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars
Get the fuck out of here

You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy,
I don't know why all the fuss about me fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before,
all they did was doubt me did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run they mouth
and try to take shots at me take shots at me

Eminem
Yo, you might see me joggin, you might see me walkin
You might see me walkin a dead rottweiler dog
with it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin
grrrr, ARF ARF Or leanin out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Drivin up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Lookin for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous
blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
startin shit like some 26 year old skinny Cartman God damnit
I'm anti Backstreet and Ricky Martin
with instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded  Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent
Whatever happened to catchin a good ol' fashioned
passionate ass whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it.. hahaha
Vanilla Ice don't like me uh uh
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me yup
Then went and dyed his hair just like me hehe
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
and run around screamin, I don't care, just bite me nah nah
I think I was put here to annoy the world
and destroy your little 4 year old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
and call themselves Clowns cause they look queer
Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away fuckin punks
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
AHHH Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow
Look at y'all runnin your mouth again
when you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10
And I don't need help, from D 12, to beat up two females
in make up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus, you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots

Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers Marshall Mathers
I'm not a wrestler guy,
I'll knock you out if you talk about me you talk about me
Come and see me on the streets alone
if you assholes doubt me assholes doubt me
And if you wanna run your mouth
then come take your best shot at me your best shot at me

Eminem
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
and this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,
so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get Bizzy
My fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers
It doesn't matter your attorney Fred Gibson's a faggot
Talkin about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass Uhh
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden, I got 90 some cousins Hey it's me
A half brother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Hey hey  And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
to buy this cheap ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
and what do I see  A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:
uhh, here   DOUBLE XL, DOUBLE XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

Em  aight
Em  Guess what  I ain't coming in yet...
I'll come in a minute
Em  Aiyyo; this is my love song, it goes like this

Eminem
Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to, mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the, sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf
And my pre diction is you're gon' probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And every thing's spinnin, you're beginnin to think women 
are swimmin in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin
over the island and cause a 42 car pile up
Look at the life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

Cause every time I go to try to leave Whoa ohh
Somethin keeps pullin on my sleeve Whoa ohh
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay Whoa ohh
These drugs really got ahold of me Whoa ohh
Cause every time I try to tell them, No No ohh
They won't let me ever let them go Go ohh
I'ma sucka all I gotta say Whoa ohh
is drugs really got a hold of me Whoa ohh

Eminem
In third grade, all I used to do
was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubix Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as Rude as Jude
Schemin on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstacy's, got me standin next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the mornin like Yo, what the fuck we do
I gotta go bitch, you know I have stuff to do
Cause if I get caught cheatin then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run
These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later
But fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
Til we walk around looking like some wind up dolls
Shit's stickin out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm goin to try to find some more

Eminem
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wollow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna want to do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning
And what's a little fight Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Mari ju uana is everywhere, where was you brought up
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin
Cause none of this shit is gonna mean shit where we're goin
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin
Even though you wake up feelin like shit every mornin
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lot of growin up to do
I still got a whole lot of throwin up to spew
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin stories
with a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysiting for Hailey while Hailey's out gettin smashed

Drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of me
Cause drugs really got ah old of me
They really got a hold of me

kill kill kill
Dahh dum, dahh dum.. dum

Mentally illll from Amityvilllle 

Eminem
I get lifted and spin til I'm half twisted
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me you'll get in imagine this

Bizarre
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was 'sleep
Pissy drunk, throwin up in the urinal YOU FUCKIN HOMO
That's what I said at my dad's funeral

Eminem
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin idiots still still
That's why the first motherfucker poppin some shit he gets killed killed
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville 'Ville
You can get capped after just havin a cavity filled filled
Ahahahaha, that's why we're crowned the murder capital still still
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin Hamburger Hill Hill
We don't do drivebys, we park in front of houses and shoot
and when the police come we fuckin shoot it out with them too
That's the mentality here here that's the reality here here
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here huh
While I'm holdin a pistol with this many calibres here here
Plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year year
Cause once I snap I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen,
when a thousand bullets come at your house
and collapse the foundation around you and they found you
and your family in it AHHHHH 
GOT DAMNIT HE MEANT IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU

Dum, tahh dum.. ta dah da
Dum, tahh dum.. ta dah da

Dr. Dre
Just let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit
on Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit Limp Bizkit
Throw on 'Guilty Conscience' at concerts
and watch mosh pits til motherfuckers knock each other unconcious
Watch out now Some of these crowds that Slim draws
is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and fulla cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw  IS  niggaz from Crenshaw
from Long Beach to South Central 
These grown ass ignorant men with hair triggers again
Hehe You and what army could harm me
D R E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach
East syde Came a long way, to makin these songs play
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uz', and I carry it all day
Blaow Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just bein Andre
but I..

Snoop Dogg
somehow, someway   tell 'em, nigga
You know about Dogg ay Snoop Dogg
Now let me cut these niggaz up and show em where da fuck I'm comin from
I get the party crackin from the shit that I be spittin son
Hit and run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns, and I love all of 'em the same   bang bang
Damn baby girl what's your name
I forgot   what'd you say it was  Damn a nigga buzzed
Hangin in the club, with my nephew Eminem
Whassup Slim Whattup cuz Whattup Snoop
The Great White American Hope, done hooked up
with the King of the motherfuckin West coast, bay bayy

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
Snoop That's, the devil, they always wanna dance

Xzibit
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin you move
You're found dead in your garage, with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it, cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust  They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin with Puff
Bitch, please   you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees   c'mon

Eminem   impersonating Snoop
Awww naww, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up, in the, heezy BAY BAY
He's Sha day

SnoopHe's so cra zay

Eminem
Hahaha  Gimme the mic, let me recite, 'til Timothy White
pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right  I'm just a criminal, makin a living
off of the world's misery   what in the world gives me the right
to say what I like, and walk around flippin the bird
Livin the urban life, like a white kid from the 'burbs
Dreamin at night of screamin at mom, schemin to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
that somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
is cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin up like a nerd on TV
or heard the CD usin the fag word so freely
it's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
You happy now  Look here

Eminem   impersonating Snoop
I start some trouble everywhere that I go that I go
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know cause they know
I start some shit they throw me out the back do' the back do'
Come back and shoot the club up with a fo' fo' a fo' fo'

Xzibit
2001 and forever
Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, X to the Z, Nate Dogg

Eminem

His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut

Eminem 
Translation
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick   ha ha
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin him
I'm like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin
Swifty Bitch it's too late
Eminem Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

Swifty
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin, creatin murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it uh huh for havin blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, Forgive me
I'm snatchin every penny   it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin, I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin me they bracelets
Chillin in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin   throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick

Bizarre
I'm a compulsive liar, settin my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
Hey, is Bizarre performing Bitch didn't you read the flyer
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
Aren't you a male dancer Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
I'm fuckin anything when I'm snortin
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin ass mom

Proof
Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a 'Stop the Violence' rally, I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin, get your ASCAP ped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
and found chopped up in a trash bag

Kuniva
We stranglin rappers until the point they can't yell
cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a Luni
I got a Yukmouth and it's polluted
I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva yo yo..
I leave ya face leakin, run up in church 
and smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon

Kon Artis
I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
with the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb
Special delivery I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin in dough

Eminem

Eminem
A lot of people ask me.. stupid fuckin questions
A lot of people think that.. what I say on records
or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life
or that I believe in it
Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody, that.. 
I'm actually gonna do it
or that I believe in it

Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause

You can't stop me from toppin these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin each March
with a brand new cd for these fuckin retards
Duhhh, and to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't Give A Fuck, still won't leave

I'm a CRIMINAL
Cuz every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime
to tell em what's on my mind   I guess I'm a CRIMINAL
but I don't gotta say a word, I just flip em the bird
and keep goin, I don't take shit from no one

Eminem
My mother did drugs   tar, liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out   disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
I'm a CRIMINAL   an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you sposed to grow up when you weren't raised
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin the word ...
My morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee
Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde haired
and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
in plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em
Replacin the doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin his place

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
tuck my dick inbetween my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin chickens ain't brave enough
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin rapist in a Jason mask

Eminem
Hi there little boys and girls FUCK YOU
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob Huh
Say hi Bob Hi Bob Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
and he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his twelve year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks AHH
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a Dr.
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
they never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, 
and what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any   it's bad for you 

See children, drugs are bahhhd c'mon
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd ask him man
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom that's right
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time she will
So kids say no to drugs that's right
So you don't act like everyone else does uh huh
Then there's really nothin else to say sing along
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay

Eminem
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it 
FUCK NO you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut Huh
Speakin of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty one years old 
After hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
His back starts tah   look like the McDonald's Arches
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him
Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him
cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you

See children, drugs are bahhhd that's right
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd that's right
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom you can
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time she will
So kids say no to drugs smoke crack
So you don't act like everyone else does that's right
And there's really nothin else to say but umm
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay

Eminem
And last but not least, one of the most humungous
problems among young people today, is fungus
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, 
bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum yum  Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em..
And sometimes you see things that aren't there Like what
Like fat woman in G strings with orange hair
Mr. Shady what's a G string  It's yarn Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em Huh
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms  I meant fungus
Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue How come
cause it comes from a cow's dung Gross
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at Oh
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee
and get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 
cause I'm bad for you

See children, drugs are bahhhd uh huh
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd put that down
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom you can ask
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time and she will
So kids say no to drugs say no
So you don't act like everyone else does like I do
And there's really nothin else to say that's right
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay

Mr. Mackey Eric Cartman
Come on children, clap along SHUT UP
Sing along children Suck my motherfuckin dick
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad South Park is gonna sue me
So don't do drugs Suck my motherfuckin penis
so there'll be more for me  Hippie  God damnit
So, fucked up, right now..

America Hahaha We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect
The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech
the United States government has sworn to uphold..
Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song .. or so we're told

Eminem
I never woulda dreamed in a million years I'd see
so many motherfuckin people, who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin ARMY marchin in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
in no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days
Who woulda thought; standin in this mirror bleachin my hair
with some peroxide, reachin for a t shirt to wear
that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keep tellin me, I ain't causin nuthin but problems
And now they're sayin I'm in trouble with the government   I'm lovin it
I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin it on

White America I could be one of your kids
White America Little Eric looks just like this
White America Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL; look how many hugs I get

Eminem
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby ooh baby Look at my sales
Let's do the math   if I was black, I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up I was like
Fuck it   until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance aand I lit a FIRE up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn; we just swapped   sittin back lookin at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now It's..

Eminem
See the problem is, I speak to suburban kids
who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'til I created so much motherfuckin turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your living rooms I came
And kids flipped, when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
waitin to choke; tightenin around my throat
Watchin me while I write this, like I don't like this Nope
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working
round the clock to try to stop my concerts early, surely
Hip Hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom
So now I'm catchin the flack from these activists when they raggin
Actin like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot, shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The posterchild, the motherfuckin spokesman now for..

So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
and piss on the lawns of the White House
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney Fuck you Tipper Gore
Fuck you with the free est of speech
this Divided States of Embarassment will allow me to have
Fuck you

I'm just playin America, you know I love you

Dr. Dre Marshall Sounds like an S.O.S.
Mathers Holy wack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fuckin right
Dr. Dre To the Rapmobile   let's go

Marshall Marshall

Eminem
Bitches and gentlemen It's SHOWTIME
Hurry hurry, step right up
Marshall
You wouldn't want to be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further adieux, I bring to you
Marshall

Eminem
You bout to witness, hip hop in its most purest
more rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but oh Doc is BACK
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
I'm inches, away from you, dear fear none
Hip Hop is in a state of nine one one so..

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
on these clowns; can I get a witness HELL YEAH

Eminem
Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers Dre, Holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
when I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more; you're used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
they make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
people when you're rappin and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
to Marshall and Andre's car ni val, c'mon Now

Eminem
It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic You already know
who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
since me and Elton, played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin a sweat
People steppin over people just to rush to the set
just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats, MC's don't see me
Believe me; BET and MTV
are gonna grieve when we leave dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
into the mountains   nothin but clowns down here
But we, ain't fuckin around round here
Yo Dre whattup Can I get hell.. HELL YEAH Now

So there you have it folks Marshall has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre, here to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because Marshall and Andre are here to stay
and never go away, until our dying day
Until we're old and grey Marshall
So until next time friends, same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening Marshall
Oh Heh

Where's my snare
I have no snare in my headphones   there you go
Yeah.. yo, yo

Eminem
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against
I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin kid that's behind
all this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's explodin
Tempers flarin from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin
Not takin nothin from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin
Keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evenin
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma
I'ma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleanin out my closet one more time
I said I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleanin out my closet

Eminem
Ha I got some skeletons in my closet
and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
before I ever had a multi platinum sellin CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
but I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cuz I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

Eminem
Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
witnessin your momma poppin prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin that someone's always goin throuh her purse and shit's missin
Goin through public housin systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
doesn't it Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma
But guess what You're gettin older now and it's cold when your lonely
And Nathan's growin up so quick he's gonna know that your phony
And Hailie's gettin so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her   she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song   keep tellin yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch; I hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
Well guess what, I  AM  dead   dead to you as can be

Eminem

Yo.. never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta, 'til I graduated to one
and got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin
Willin to stick out my neck, for respect if it meant
life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just want to see, if it's true
If it's you, what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel, it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel
you're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it, if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it 'til it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bones crush
or crumble, I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bones crush
or crumble, I will never stumble

Eminem
I love pissin you off, it gets me off
Like my lawyers, when the fuckin judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitch it's news
Pistol whippin motherfuckin bouncers, six two
Who needs bullets As soon as I pull it, you SWEAT bullets
An EXCELLENT method to get rid of the next bully
ACTUALLY better cause instead of you murderin
you can hurt 'em and come BACK again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin out their haltertops
Runnin and duckin out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, cause

Eminem
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of 'Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin to it
You motherfuckers could NEVER do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped to two inch
So ticky tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity

Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left right left

Sayin goodbye, I'm sayin goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin goodbye, I'm sayin goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin goodbye, I'm sayin goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin goodbye, I'm sayin goodbye to Hollywood Hollywood
Sayin goodbye, I'm sayin goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin goodbye, I'm sayin goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin goodbye, I'm sayin goodbye to Hollywood

Eminem
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself layin on my knees in cuffs
which shoulda been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff
and just leave   how come I couldn't see this shit myself
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
to catch me, the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
I'm standin here swingin like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now I'm..

Eminem
I bury my face in comic books, cause I don't want to look
at nothin, this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would
And end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are pilin all at once
Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottomin out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God, I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter, layin in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps
of my dad, cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had was growin up to be like his fuckin ass
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em I'm..

Eminem
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
for me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick
Publicity stunt my ass, consume my fuckin dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whupped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp
on the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin from bein a no one to seein
everything blow up and all you did was just grow up emceein
It's fuckin crazy, cause all I wanted was to give Hailie
the life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated
So I'm sayin..

Goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood Goodbye
Please don't cry for me It's been real
When I'm gone for good This shit is not for me
So goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood I'm not a fuckin star
Please don't cry for me No way
When I'm gone for good I'm goin back home

Eminem Obie.. yo
Eminem Damn, you straight dog

That's why I ain't got no time
for these games and stupid tricks
or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin sick
That's how dicks be gettin drips
Fallin victims to this shit
from these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time...

Obie Trice
Yo; I woke up fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I had a bag of the skunk won in last nights Tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaners
fucked me good, you shoulda seen this
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable
French roll stylin, body like a stallion
Sizin up the figure while my shit gettin bigger
Debatin on a fuck or do I want to be her nigga
Caressin this bitch, plus I'm checkin out them tits
Sippin on that fine shit I ain't used to buyin
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
like takin hoe's money, but that's another story
For surely, the pussy on toast
After we toast her clothes fell like Bishop in  Juice 
The womb beater, clean pussy eater
Insertin my jock in that spot hotter than the hottest block
Don't stop Response I got when I was knockin it
Clock steady tickin, kinky finger lickin
and can on, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga, like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin at the lips, the one between the hips
Pubic hairs lookin like some sour cream dip
without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a FAT ASS nut, then I woke up next
like what the fuck is goin on here This bitch evaporated
Pussy and all just picked up and vacated
Now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
And Dr. Wesley, tellin me I really got that shit

Eminem
Now I don't wanna hit no woman but this chick's got it comin
Someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
and she's pregnant, but she's eggin me on
Beggin me to throw her off the steps of this porch
My only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to any violence of any sort
But what's she shovin me for Doesn't she love me no more
Wasn't she huggin me four minutes ago at the door
Man, I'm this close to goin toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin you she wants a divorce
She's havin another baby of the month, and it's yours
And you find out it isn't cause this bitch has been visitin someone else
and suckin his dick and kissin you on the lips when you get back
to Michigan, now the plot is thickenin worse
Cause you feel like you've been stickin your fuckin dick in a hearse
So you paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they told you this shit, you've been holdin your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out lookin like Dennis the Menace
and it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it
So you jet back home, because you gon' GET that hoe
When you SEE her, you gon' bend her fuckin NECK BACK YO
Cause you love her, you never would expect that blow
Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low
Jesus, I don't believe this, bitch works at the cleaners
Bringin me home diseases, swingin from Obie's penis
She's so deceivin, shit this hoe's a genius
She G'd us..

Eminem I'm busy

Two trailer park girls go round the outside;
round the outside, round the outside

Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back

I've created a monster, cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver huh
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when I'm not co operating
When I'm rockin the table while he's operating hey
You waited this long, now stop debating
Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovu lating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, FUCK YOU DEBBIE

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty, without me

Little Hellions, kids feelin rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin like prisoners helpless
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells BITCH
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my ass; you asked for me
Well I'm back, na na na na na na na na na na
enter in, endin up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent You sent for me

A tisket a tasket, I go tit for tat with
anybody who's talkin this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby  You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno
Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
But sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm dis gus ting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
to do black music so selfishly
and used it to get myself wealthy
Hey There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me

Chem hie la la la, la la la la la

Eminem Kids

Eminem
These ideas are, nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
to see him walkin around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about, his fuckin dad walkin out
Cause he just hates him so bad that he, blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin back
Talkin black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants; doo rags and a stockin cap
His step father hit him so he, socked him back
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go

C'mon Sing with me Sing
Sing for the year Sing it
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear C'mon
Sing it with me, Just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away...

Eminem
Entertainment is changin, intertwinin with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unnholy, only have one homie
Only this gun   lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
or they can degrate; or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin on corners and porches just rappin
to havin a fortune, no more kissin ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin to me religiously
So I'm signin CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin menace this shit doesn't make sense B
It's all political, if my music is literal
and I'm a criminal how the FUCK can I raise a little girl
I couldn't; I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera   that was a FIST that hit you

Eminem
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols
and they want to get one cause, they think the shit's cool
Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it How we can come from practically nothin
to bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine
Who post pin up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night wishin they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin to you   but we're the fuckin shit in they eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits live on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...

as it appears on Eminem's website and in his liner notes is just plain WRONG

Dina Rae Mmmmm..
Marshall You high baby
Dina Rae Yeahhh
Marshall Oh yeah
Dina Rae Talk to me
Marshall You want me to tell you somethin
Dina Rae Uh huh
Marshall I know what you want to hear

I know you want me baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you baby I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl, come be in Shady's world
I want to grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I want to save you girl, come be in Shady's world
Ooh boy you drive me crazy Bitch, you make me earl

Eminem
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound, I'm single now
Got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
in a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit You make me sick
Superman ain't savin shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muh'fuckin slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask
Kiss my dick   get my cash
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice, to buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin to be my new wife
What you Mariah Fly through twice

Bridge: Eminem
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass
on that fuckin runway ho

Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman your Superman

Eminem
Don't get me wrong    I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't want to flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

Bridge

Eminem
First thing you say, I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
you're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yea girl run that game
Hailie Jade I love that name
Love that tattoo   what's that say
Rot in pieces Uh, that's great
First off you don't know Marshall
at all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy whodi
you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a tampax
and slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

Bridge

Yo, I can't sing   I feel like singing
I want to fuckin sing
Cause I'm happy   yeah, I'm happy, haha
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out...

Eminem   singing
Somedays I sit, starin out the window
Watchin this world pass me by
Sometimes I think, there's nothin to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy; I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here Am I just wastin my time
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes

Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin on me
Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

Eminem   singing
My baby girl, keeps gettin older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't phase me; inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes

Eminem   rapping
Man if I could sing, I'd keep singin this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin as long as my father
to show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
that I'ma pistol packin drug addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest
cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world, and I think my neck is breakin
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
but I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin   three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should have seen it comin, what'd I stick my penis up in
Wouldn't have ripped the pre nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tommorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted

And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin on me
Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothing can take her from me

Eminem
Wooo Told you I can't sing
Oh well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said, if you ever need anything
Daddy would be right there Guess what
Daddy's here, and I ain't going nowhere baby

Bizarre
Music.. reality..
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers.. have a responsibility
to these kids.. psyche

Eminem
If I, were to die murdered in cold blood tommorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love, or would it matter
Could never be the lead off batter
if there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see saw battlin
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate, I done came way
too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for a joke You smokin crack
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryin to smack this one out the park, five thousand mark
Y'all steady tryin to drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothin but piss me off, lid to the can of whip ass
Just twist me off, see me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shootin I'm just tryin to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you really feelin froggish leap
Yo Slim, you gon' let him get away with that
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man I hate this crap
This ain't rap, this is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip hop with real life when the music stops

Swifty McVay
Ain't no gettin rid of McVay, if so you woulda tried
The only way I'm leavin this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemies' crib
I'm every nigga's favorite arch enemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a dillinger in the dark dilligently
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight
to awake neighbors for acres
I'll murder you, I gauge and have me turn into a mad man
Son of sam bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin, you think not
You got balls We can see how large, when the music stops

Kon Artis
I was happy havin a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy but it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dog
And you ain't got nuttin left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin with their hands out, checkin for your record when it's sellin
When it ain't that's the end, no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink, till your car spin you think
DAMN When you slam into the wall
and you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow wonder would they even call
When the music stops

Kuniva
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up lookin for you with a pistol, sippin a can of penzoil
I'm revved up, who said what, when lead bust
your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
Tossed in the paddywagon; braggin about how you shouted
like a coward, bullets devoured you, showered you niggaz
If I was you niggaz, I'd run while given a chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself it can hurt me
Just the thought of dyin alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryin to walk how G's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin tug of war with your life
Deliver that shit that coroner's like
You hype poppin shit in broad daylight
Nigga you're a goner at night   when the music stops

Proof
Instigators, turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like WOOF
Proof nigga I'ma wolf, get your whole roof
caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe shit the more I moves
It's _Hill Street_, this is hardcore _Blues_
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues nigga
Or make the news, betcha all y'all move
When the uzi pop you better drop, when the music stop

Bizarre
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to Rock the Bells
NWA said Fuck the Police, now I'm in jail
Ninety three was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson   who gon' tell me I ain't Mike
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin Priscilla tonight
Flyin down Sunset smokin crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimey and gritty
Marilyn Manson I dyed my hair blue, and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm goin in shock

Dre So I'm out the game huh
Dre Whatever
Em  Haha Well I'm witcha homies
Dre Okay; let's handle the small shit

Eminem
I was born to brew up storms and stir up shit
Kick up dust, CUSS 'til I slur up spit
Grew up   too quick went through too much do too much shit
Corrupt, and I'm a pour it on like syrup bitch
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk the shit for what it's worth
'til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pulled no punches that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll EAT shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit

Dr. Dre
Creep wit me, as we take a lil' trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
But what about Jermaine Fuck Jermaine
He don't belong speakin mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think, I don't read
your lil' interviews, and see what you're sayin
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, Mini Me with a bunch of little Mini Yous
runnin around your backyard swimmin pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds

Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
how you say it whenever you sayin it, just remember
how you said it when you were sprayin it
So who you playin with huh.. huh.. huh.. huh

Eminem
Amateurs drink veteran piss
from a Dixie Cup, if you ever mix me up
or CONFUSE ME with a Canibus or Dre with a DUPRI
We'll rub it in, every club you're in will have you
blackballed and make sure you never rap a fuckin gain
Dre ain't havin it; long as I'm here to play Devil's Advocate

Dr. Dre
If there was some magic shit
I could wave over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
and buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would

Eminem
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't; not even if I could

Dr. Dre
From the hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered

Eminem
And I'ma only sucka punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off
Cause I know if they get up I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a FUCK  White 'Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill'
and grow up, to be Atilla, go nuts and be a pillar

Dr. Dre
And I'm, somethin of a phenom'
One puff of the chron', I'm unstoppable
I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
so come along with us come on

Dr. Dre
Now anybody who knows Dre
knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin all day
But I handle my business cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up I'ma fuck up your day
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
Cause this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it
and you die tryin to violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated; eyes dilated

Eminem
Heh, like my old lady
Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
is two different things, dependin on your mood if it swings
Think too many things
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
Catch a contact then I'm gone and I'm back
I speed right; and my looseleaf's my launchpad

Dr. Dre
And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything, catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest, and invest
in somethin to protect your head and neck

Eminem
And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm best
in the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death
Five mics in The Source  Ain't holdin my fuckin breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect
'fore I'll breathe to collect a fuckin check

Dre Watch your fuckin mouth

as it appears on Eminem's website and in his liner notes is just plain WRONG

Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you, try to find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse

Eminem
Till I collapse I'm spillin these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin 'em
Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pinnin 'em
and I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin 'em
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hoch venom
Adrenalin shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop
Amoxacillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop killin hip hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of 'Pac listeners
You're comin with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin up
Fo' shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out   am I high Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, till my bones collapse

Eminem
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin you get
when you real and you spit an' people are feelin your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
tryin to hold on to it cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a LOT of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does NOT offend me
That's why you see me walkin around like nothin's botherin me
Even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

Eminem
What is he thinkin How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on ev ery word
I'll probably NEVER get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse
My thoughts, are sporadic, I act, like I'm a addict
I rap, like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin at 'em
The track is on some battlin raps who want some static
Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is WACK if I'm not the baddest, so

Eminem Until the roof
N.Dogg Until the roof
Eminem The roof comes off
N.Dogg The roof comes off
Eminem Until my legs
N.Dogg Until my legs
Em   N Give out from under me

Eminem I will not fall, I will stand tall
Eminem Feels like no one can beat me

Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy I'll bet you do
Who's your daddy

Hailie Daddy what are you doing
Em   H Okay then Everybody, listen up
Eminem I'm goin to hell Who's comin with me
Hailie Somebody please help him I think my dad's gone cray zayy

Eminem
There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
to show you there ain't nothin I can't take this chainsaw to
I cut 'em off, and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
inside of a hall with my framed autographed sunglasses
with Elton John's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin my ass off
All this time me and Dre been fuckin with hats off
Suck it Marshall So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'fore I push this motherfuckin button and blast off
Blow every fuckin thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop When will I knock the crap off

There's really nothin else to say, I I can't explain it
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby
There's nothin you could do or say, that could ever change me
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie

Eminem
It's like my mother always told me
Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine
and God dammit you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nuthin nice to say then don't say nuthin
... uh, fuck that shit bitch
Eat a motherfuckin dick, chew on a prick
and lick a million motherfuckin cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfuckin gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy whipped bitch, eat pussy
and have pussy lips glued to my face with a clit ring
in my nose than quit bringin my flows
Quit givin me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenee meene mini moe
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more

Eminem
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
at the same time, can make you dry your eyes
with the same rhyme; see what you're seein is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first
cause when I speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd yank my fuckin teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin lightnin twice at once
and die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
and kicked and hit with shit everytime I sung
like R. Kelly as soon as Bump and Grind comes on
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
inside of a plane, aimed at the World Trade
Standin on Ronnie's grave, screamin at the sky
'til clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
The parents are pissed but the kids love it
9 millimeter heater stashed in 2 seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

Hailie
Ha ha ha ha
You're funny daddy

Eminem
Lord please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Momma had a baby and it's head popped off head popped off
head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
My momma don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin dropped off
gettin dropped off, gettin dropped off, gettin dropped off, gettin dropped off
Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn 'til somebody finally took me in
My Great Aunt and Uncle, Edna 'n Charles Edna 'n Charles
Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song
sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song
It went a little somethin like
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my daaaaaaaaaaad

Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, but what about me
where does that leave me  Well I guess that I'm between predominantly
both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin word again I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you
Do you think that I'm kidding  What do I look like some kind of idi 
wait a minute, shit, don't answer that   why am I so misunderstood
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit, it's tush mull bish
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions 
nd his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it
Shit, if you only knew the half of it

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know what it feel like, they know me cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry go round
Here we go now, doe se doe now, curtains up, the show must go
Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Eminem Oh
Eminem That's him baby, let's go
Eminem Detroit

Eminem
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Drezy'll
have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit I layed to tape 'fore they erase me
I may be a little too fast paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
twenty times cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
like I'm going too fast cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushin up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I the heavenly gates, I'd be cool beside Jay Z
For every single die hard fan who embrace me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom, far as she raised me
in a neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me, what I am today see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryin to strip me of my credibility or make me look fake G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been savin
to say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out, and try to about face me
Cause I've been patiently waitin for the day
that we finally meet, in the same place to see

No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MC's I eat up
Ohhhh, it's never enough

50 Cent
My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You gon', say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
The smell of victory love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit, graze it
Your peace talk, save it, your shit sounds, dated
You're over rated, I'm obli gated, to
study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin attention boy
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss shit
To be specific I go ballistic it's hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play you ain't gotta sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it bag it or chop it
It get you high over and over but you gotta cop it
When it's hot it's hot, your hatin is undeniable, stop it

middle quote is from a speech Spiro Agnew made on May 22, 1970.

What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough,
if you will, to be saved.  Not in a religious sense, but not to constitute
what this country, at times calls yeah their throw away children.
We all have this idea that we should, move up a little bit
from our parents' station and each generation should do a little bit better.

Aight c'mon, let's cut the bullshit enough, let's get it started
Let's start addressin this issue and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
statements that's made on this tape and this whole origin of
the music that we all know and love, the music we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryin to destroy
Let's rewind it to eighty nine, when I was a boy
On the Eastside of Detroit, crossin 8 Mile into Warren
In the hick territory, I'd like to share a story
This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, and I'm well aware
that I don't belong here, you've made that perfectly clear
I get my ass, kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel Air Shoppin Center just for stoppin in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it haulin my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
The good old notorious, so well known tracks

So let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

I'd roam in the streets so much, they'd call me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up, to get me a lift to
8 Mile and Van Dyke, or steal a God damn bike
From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark, to me Kim had to walk
Back to her momma's, from Chalmers, after dark
To sneak me in the house, when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time, I first met Proof with Goofy
Gary on the steps at Osbourne, handin out some flyers
We was doin some talent shows at Centerline High
I told him to stop by and check us some time
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head, like white boys don't know to rhyme
I spit out a line, and rhymed birthday with first place
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
With compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

Chrous

My first year of ninth grade, can't forget that day of school
It was cool, 'til your man MC Shan came through
And said that Puma's the brand, cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors, but man, God damn, they flew
Must have been true, because man, we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones, the Cool J, ice lamb, suede too
But we just threw them in the trash, like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next, X Clan debuted
Professor X  Vanglorious exist in a state of
red, black, and green with a KEY, SISSIES 
Now with this bein the new trend, we don't fit in
Crackers is out, with Cactus Albums, blackness is in
African symbols and medallions, represent black power
And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard
and Butter would go to the mall
with them all over our necks like we're showin 'em off
Not knowin at all we was bein laughed at
You ain't even half black; you ain't 'posed to have that
homey, let me grab that, and that Flava Flav clock
we gon' have to snatch that, all I remember is meetin back at
Manics's basement, sayin how we hate this
How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me, back in eighty nine me
and Kim broke up for the first time, she was tryin to two time me
And there was this black girl at our school who thought I was cool
cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein me
And oh, the irony, guess what her name was
Ain't even gonna say it plus, the same color hair as hers was
And blue contacts, and a pair of jugs
The bombest God damn girl in our whole school
If I could pull it, not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired, I was supposed to dump her
But she dumped me for this black guy, and that's the last I
ever seen or heard or spoke to the Ol' Foolish Pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape, and it ain't that bad
But it was, I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize apologize I was wrong was wrong
Cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a ho

Shut the fuck up, you fuckin pieces of shit
Get the fuck away from me you big fuckers 

Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down..

Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
We're toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never 'sposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin toe to toe with the Benzino
It don't matter I'd never drag 'em in battles that I can handle
'less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song, and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy somethin I helped build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
And that was just out of respect, for not runnin my mouth
And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, now I'm talkin a man
who literally saved my life, like fuck it I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
I'm still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute, because

There used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme and
wouldn't have to worry about, one of your people dyin
But now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck him, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came up
was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it, has got a grudge against me for nothin
Well fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy bein pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder INC
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
that's willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than ANY award is
But I ain't tryin to have none of people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all, 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin
I'm just willin to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin
off at your jaws well then I can, cause frankly I'm sick of talkin
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause

I pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States of America..
And to the republic, for which it stands..
Eminem People
.. one nation, under God, indivisible..
Eminem It feels so good to be back
.. with liberty and justice for all
Eminem Mosh with me now

You scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight tthrough the mind
I exercize my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight and you take it as I'ma whip someone's ass
If you don't understand don't even bother to ask
A father who has, grown up with a fatherless   past
Who has blown up now, to rap phenomenon that has
or at least shows no difficulty multi taskin
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
entrepreneur, who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Whose has had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
of his career typical manure movin past that
Mr. Kiss His Ass Crack, he's a class act
Rubberband man yeah, he just snaps back

Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
to procede, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me, and I won't steer you wrong 
Put your faith, and your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light, at the end, of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
C'mon

All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together let's all form, and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build, from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black 
Don't matter what color all that metters we're gathered together
to celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah the wetter the better
They ain't gon' stop us they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no we say yeah, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home c'mon, just

Imagine it pourin, just rainin down on us
Mosh pits outside the Oval Office, someone's tryin
to tell us somethin maybe this is God just
saying we're responsible, for this monster
This coward that we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin   how could, we allow 
somethin like this without, pumpin our fist now
this is our, final hour..
Let me, be the voice, and your strength, and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to emplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six teen
million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al'Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a higher anarchy 
Strap him with an AK 47, let him go
fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles
to fight on our own soil, no more psychological warfare
to trick us to thinkin we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country we're patronizin a hero
Look in his eyes it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped
and replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why   cause I told you to fight

Eminem
And as we procede, to mosh through this Desert Storm
And these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences, and assemble our own army
To disarm, THIS weapon of mass destruction
that we call our President, for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak, and be heard
Mr. President  Mr. Senator

children

Eminem
There I go.. thinkin of you again

You, don't, know, how, sick, you, make, me
You make me fuckin sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you, I puke
You, must, just, not, know oh oh oh oh oh ohh
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you, I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable, for this type of song   whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I can think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink ta
So fuck it I'ma start right here, I'll just be briefer
Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
of you on my arm, but what do I go and do
I go and get another one, now I got two, ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooh
I'm sittin here, with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim, shiii iii iii iit
If you only knew, how much I hated you
For every motherfuckin thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standin here cryin over you, booo ooo ooo ooo hoo

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter, that you'd probably just shred up   yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta
A stupid piece'a   paper I'd rather let you see how
much I fuckin hate you in a freestyle
You're a fuckin cokehead slut I hope you fuckin die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin guts you fuckin slut I hope you die, die ie ie ie ie ie ie
But please don't get me wrong   I'm not bitter I'm mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yak, aaa aaa aaaak
But when else can I do, I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I just move on I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you, now all I wanna do, is puuu uuu uuuke

Eminem
God damn...
Fuckin bitch

Eminem
Ohhhhhh Yeah
So much for first single on this one

It's the Mr. Picked on Christopher Reeves just for no reason
He used to be Superman
Now we're pourin liquor, on the curb in his, name for him
Eminem you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin your ass for everything you've ever, said
It goes one for the money two for the fuckin show, ready, get set let's go
Here comes the buckin bronco
Stompin and stampedin up the damn street like dem buffalo soldiers
I told ya I'm bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers is dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go   when will I stop I don't know
Tryin to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible, though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away with murder
I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
Better watch what you say, just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape, you swear to God you was playin
Whether or not you was little Joshua, gosh I wish I coulda told ya
to not do the same, cause one day it could cost you your name

But I just fucked that up so
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
That you hear on your radio

And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derreck bare naked
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly   he he he he he he
To be so young and naive
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled they cherish every picture
with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
with these words   am I a jerk or just jerk chicken
22 jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk
Wait a minute, what am I sayin  Allow me to run it back
Am I just jerkin the chain, am I beserk or insane
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin the damn camera
Filmin one of them Paris Hilton homemade pornos
Just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of them fuckin
When they were just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club and dusted 'em
And went straight to The Source with them
cause they coulda sworn someone said
Nuh   and then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
Uhh, uhh, and then they come to
Find out it, was Justin sayin I'm go nna cum

Any opinions or somethin you just wanna get off your chest
and address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1 800 I'm A Dick Sucker, I love to suck a dick
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
that I fall out with Dre, wake up gay, and make up with Ray hey
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, ba ca BA KAWK
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick
in your mouth, I'm done you can fuck off, fucka FUCK OFF

Yeahhh..
Definitely   definately, definately dope
Definitely   definately K Mart, yeah

Eminem
You find me offensive; I find you offensive for finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw out or line any fences; if so
to what extents if any should I go  Cause it's getting expensive 
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage
to the brain when I go to lengths; this
far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too God damned sensitive
It's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
And Christo pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me I even believe I
had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must of put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman I killed Super man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic

Cause I ain't got no legs, or no brain
Nice to meet you, hi my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became; with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil   my new name is...
Rain Man

Eminem
Now in the bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed, have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse
for your actions; either before during or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids, in a more derogatory way
But who's to say, what's fair to say
And what not to say, let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre what up I got a question if I may yeah
Is it gay to play putt putt golf with a friend yeah
And watch his butt butt when he tees off yeah
But uh, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hut hut
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay  I just need to clear things up
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because

Eminem
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
When am I gonna come to my good senses
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is tellin me Spider Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whoop ass canister
God damnit Dre, where's the God damned beat yeah
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yup yup, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's ass and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon I
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can and zoom I 
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I don't even gotta make no God damned sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

Eminem
Cause AHH AHH AHH AHH AHH
Yup, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre
Super dope, beatmaker
Two thousand, two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and se seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three..

I don't understand Why are you being so mean
You're a mean mean man

You are just jealous of me cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only cause you're, just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open, your mind   your eyes close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore
into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make Yoo Hoo  Hippity ga ga boo boo
Psych I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir I have a question   why do I always sense this
undeniable tension, from the moment that I enter into the room
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned
I've been dying to ask, it's been itchin at me, is it just because

Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was   I fucked up
Psych I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up, ain't it
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay  You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something, what You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, tour breath stinks, wanna chew some gum
Yes I do sir, what am I on  You sir are on truth serum
Marshall I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurity

Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog, looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblence here
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How about now  What do you have in common
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room
somewhere crying, curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is tortureous
My point is this   that if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a..

Get the fuck off my dick

I have needs, I'm not done, not til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B
I sing song, it go Ring a Chong, a Ching Chong Chong Chong Ching
Psych I joke, I joke, I keed, I keed
If I offend, I'm sorry, please please forgive
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away anything I say and you will love it

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an   ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee pee go
D DOING DOING DOING
Jessica Simpson, looks oh so tempting

Eminem
Mary Kate and Ashley used to be so handsome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying FREEZE   D DOING DOING DOING
What do you mean, freeze  GEEZ, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theatre, please
I did not even get to see, Mary Kate's shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simple plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy 
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh cause there's a puppet on my hand

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an   ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee pee go
D DOING DOING DOING
Hilary Duff is, not quite old enough so
I ain't never seen her   butt like that
Maybe next year I'll say ass and she'll make my pee pee go
D DOING DOING DOING

Eminem
The way she moves she dances like a go go
In that video she sings get out your puzzle
I need a new boyfriend, hi my name is JoJo
Police saying FREEZE   D DOING DOING DOING
What do you mean freeze  My computers will be seized
And my keys, to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word pee pee
Pee, on the radio but I think I did
Janet is that a breast  I think I just saw a tit
Psych I joke, I joke, I keed, I keed
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Ah nuld, get dowwwn

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an   ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee pee go

Dr. Dre THE FUCK IS WRONG WITCHU
Eminem HA

Eminem
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's something I gotta say, say
For all the fools, who fell for the first
girl who comes their way, way
I've been down that road and, now I'm back
Sittin on square one, one
Tryin to pick myself up
Where I started from

Obie Trice
I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us we was like mates of soul
Nothin could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose to more shows
Haunted you nights I suppose, that's how it go
With time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
and Obie's grinnin, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggaz they gon' hate
We established this way befo' we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire, and

Spend some time with me   savour, the good times
I, never thought I'd find, someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, cause you just crossed the line..
Spend some time with me   savour, the good times

Eminem
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin clue as to who you truly are
'til you went as far as goin and snoopin through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And whoulda even knew that, who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them God damned darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
'til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

Stat Quo
Ha ha, yeah right bitch
Spend some time with my dick
In most cases   Stat's attitude is fuck a bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was diff erent, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub lic, we sufferin because of this
Shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin to play slick, thinkin I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss
We started off closer than close, but who coulda predicted to know
your triflin ways woulda stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself, do I love these hoes  NOPE

50 Cent
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin my dick
We played the phone game a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin, talkin like a opportunist do
Why talk when suckin my dick is the real career move
Said she's an inspirin actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit

Eminem
Yeah...
I know sometimes, things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you
Straighten up little soldier   stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin about  You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
when I'm gone but I'm tryin to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin, wipe them tears, daddy's here no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney, Uncle's crazy ain't he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got it this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
I try to keep up sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
the harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things growin up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein
together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin that we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold, ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em weren't from me, cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom, was savin money for you in a jar
Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
on the Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
and met Dr. Dre, and flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seein daddy on the TV
And momma didn't like it, and you and Laney were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscin
Lookin at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it don't it
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

Eminem
And if you ask me to daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad
Ha ha 

sample from Crazy on You by Heart
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you.. crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on youuuuuuuuuu ohhhhhh

Can't you see what you do to me baby
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic
One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanted sex
You make me crazy, the way we act like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit
Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us
We can't figure out if it's lust
or it's love which that is attractin us to each other
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin bitch
but I stay and still stick it out with you
even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just cause I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby
Because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as I am
Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin devices out your personal vibrators and dildos
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24 but you're plenty more ma ture
than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin
You play your position you never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept out of mine
I wonder what's on your mind, sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign

Or maybe you did, maybe you like me and stuff
Maybe cause we're crazy in loooove

Eminem
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
as intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me
as much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply   gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
as I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me you're the air I breathe I believe
if you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Elaina to my Hailie
You are the words that I'm lookin for when I'm tryin to describe
how I feel inside and the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me

And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe cause we're crazy in loooove

I told y'all motherfuckers I was comin back oh shit
What now nigga, what now  What  Brewster Projects nigga

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin shots off

Bizarre
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm tryin to run and get my motherfuckin gun
Nigga what about yo' wife Nigga fuck my wife
I'm tryin to run and save my motherfuckin life
Oh, shit  The shooter's comin
Bitches hollerin, niggaz runnin
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm tryin to make it to the St. Andrew's door
Even DJ Houseshoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forget my tec
I don't see nobody, but Fat Five and Hex

Eminem Kuniva you aight
Kuniva These niggaz is trippin
Eminem Where's Bizarre at

Kuniva
I'm tryin to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin everywhere and niggaz is whylin
Two minutes ago we was all jokin and smilin
This chick is clingin on to me, sobbin and sighin
Sayin she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin
But it's real and it's on and caps is gettin peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late

Kon Artis I been tryin to call you all day motherfucker where you at
Kon Artis What with they car
Swifty Mc With a gat nigga, and my tire flat
Kon Artis Is you hit
Swifty Mc I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
Swifty Mc It was a black Mitsubishi
Kon Arist Shit, that's the click we beefin with
Swifty Mc Maaaaan
Kon Artis I swear

Swifty McVey
And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leavin a carcass today
And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up

Eminem
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin outside the door, waitin in line still
tryin to get inside the club to see D 12 perform
The fire marshalls know, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd
fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aimin for, six feet away is the door
into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flyin all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, havin a mazeltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von  He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck  Oh my God, it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, bein trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it
I scoop D, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
made it to the front door and collapsed
on the steps looked up and I seen Swift
Shootin it out but I can't see who he's shootin it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezin his four fifth

Kon Artis
Yo, it's a Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight cause I'm poppin niggaz tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryin to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
that shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender bitch bring me a bottle of Mo'
I just wanna know who drivin the black Mitsubishi
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three piece

50 Sh sh sh SHA DY Aftermath
Em Ha ha, G G G G, G Unit
50 Ha ha Ha ha

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce toniiiiiight
And if they don't let us in through the front do'
Come through the siiiiiide
Cause I don't wanna ever leave the game without
at least saying goodbyyyyyye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
scream one last tiiiiiime

Eminem
Get your ass up for the Doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the Doctor, c'mon now
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin on the edge of your seat, get on down

Dr. Dre
Time's up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase begin
Look who's got you goin crazy again
I'ma trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you somethin that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back

Eminem
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip, we out grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin and moanin, whinin and bitchin
Sit and observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
Why I send multi platinum albums, later three diamond
Worldwide, we on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin

Em When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk
Dr Get it crunk CRUNK, CRUNK, CRUNK
Em And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and
50 Jump JUMP, JUMP, JUMP

Dr. Dre
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you artists censored
I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches

Eminem
We keep the party rockin off the hinges
We ain't showin off, we're just goin off, popular contentions

Dr. Dre
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all
washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin
Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin in a second PUMP PUMP
That's why we always save the best cut last
to make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

Eminem
Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
and leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

Eminem 50 Cent, c'mon

50 Cent
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

Dr. Dre
And plenty honies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

Eminem
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

Dr. Dre
You can catch me in the studio, bangin out the beats to
provide you with the heat that keep blazin out your speaker

Eminem
So never say never cause Shady/Aftermath together
along with G Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc and Shady no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that uh

Eminem
Yeah  Ha ha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry bout that Detox album, it's comin
We gon' make Dre do it ha ha
50 Cent, G Unit
Obie Trice, D Twizy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre, we ain't leavin
Let's go  Ha ha
Ladies and gentlemen
Thank you all for comin out
PEACE

Eminem Oh shit, I almost forgot, you're comin with me

Eminem singing
There's an intruder.. in my house
He cut my phone line.. can't dial out
I scream for police.. but I doubt
They're gonna hear me.. when I shout

Eminem
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time, when I get pulled over
there's a Doberman Pinscher and a pitbull in the seat
These pigs'll get bit foolin with me, quit foolin with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
you wanna harass with this limo tinted glass
Flashin that flashlight on my ass, where was you at
last night when them assholes, ran up on my grass
Rapper slash actor   kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with bear palms
Yeah right   they comin with bombs, I'm comin with flare guns
We as Americans

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin by any means 
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America 
And we are Americans

Eminem
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin beaucoup vests
Drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
with you know who, with an 'S' tatooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin quicker than makin
paper airplanes out of a twenty   fuck money
It's never been said, but I set precedents
and the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been bastard, the shit shoulda been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot, fuck that shit
I done seen how fast this rap shit
can turn into some pap pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time they got fuckin auto ma tic
Ain't no one gon' test this mon, clack click

Eminem
sshhhhh
I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
Under my longjohns, under my Sean Johns
When runnin with the long arm of the law I'm long gone
I'ma do five years, no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea to stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared mapped on my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' gimme my semi but I got my mac back

Eminem

The more you, put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me  I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Cause you love me, and I love you more

It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust, cause neither one of us trust each other
So we fuck 'til we bust and we cuss each other, out
We know what it's about, SHOUT
'til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fistfight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin here with you
There ain't nothin anyone could ever say or ever do cause

Cause I hate you, do you hate me
Good   cause you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry
It makes me, wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spred rumors
But they ain't got proof, if they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she screwin me
But you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed
if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin.. yeah I would
Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
that would be this soft and warm
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know, that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why

I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh why must we try, is it really so rough
that we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin to ourselves, that's the beauty of it geah
Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent up rage
we both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
by someone else, we've both been with someone else
And someone else's problems neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoop la, all the whoopty woo
What you put me through, fuckin whoopty do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
you wouldn't do what, you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
this time, cause this time girl I'm tellin you what
You do it again I'm fuckin you up

Outlude
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers, and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
So when you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me whore

Eminem
Once you call my name out things will never be the same
They shoulda never let us get our foot in this game

I been missin a screw like Bishop in Juice, I could lose it
at any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow, just so that
I don't explode and, have another episode
I'm waitin for that next beef, I'm cocked locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm goin bananas, my dick's so hard Anna Nicole could
use it to fuckin pole vault with
Oh shit  I mean when she was still bloated
before they cut her stomach open and lypo'ed it
Anybody I throw flames at, gets a name
It's a game, cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for ten minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that
They all tryna get that stamp
They after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand How to Rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery
and the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
that we had more in common that we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
Cause we started thinkin God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence it is, cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and uhh
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye to eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stompin, I been rompin
since Tim Dog was, hollerin, Fuck Compton
I was whylin, freestylin
Back when, they were still makin, Maxell casettes
It wasn't even rap sell us yet, that tells us that
any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya don't stop... 

I never seen no chick like this
This bitch can twist like a damn contortionist
Condom on my dick, of course it is
This bitch don't know what abortion is
So I can't cum in her, fucks like a porn star
Looks like Jenna, fack I'm gonna
cum I think my rubber's comin off
But oh it's so fucking wet and soft
Fack, I'm gonna start lettin off
And she's on top, I'm gonna facking
Oh God, oh don't do that
Don't stop  Stop don't, I don't mean don't stop

AH, your finger just went in my ass
OW THAT HURTS, take it out now
Ohh, wait a minute, oww
Put it back in, in in in
This don't mean I'm gay, I don't like men
I like boobs, boobs, boobs
Now see that gerbil, grab that tube

Ohh, I'm cuming, OHH YEAH
Fack, I just came again
Okay pull it out now, errrr
Oh fack yeah, wait he's not out

Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube
Shove a gerbil in your ass through a tube

Eminem
Whatever..
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fuck it 
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest MC on this    on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and I rest again peacefully peacefully..
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 
in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me speak to me..
I don't know you and no, 
I don't owe you a mo therfuck in thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty..
No patience is in me and if you offend me 
I'm liftin you 10 feet liftin you 10 feet.. in the air 
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you of all you..
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

Eminem
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
And, Oh, it's his lyrical content  
the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me finger at me..
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on Marilyn on Marilyn.. and the heroin
Where were the parents at  And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci ty
havin this happenin this happenin..
then attack Eminem cause I rap this way rap this way..
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire 
to burn and it's burnin and I have returned

Eminem
I'm so sick and tired of bein admired
that I wish that I would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on My Name is..
And pigeon holed into some pop py sensation
to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience got the patience..
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk 
with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin 
the same fuckin questions fuckin questions..
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out
cause they drivin me crazy drivin me crazy.. I can't take it 
I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for ev ery fan that I get
But I can't take a SHIT, in the bathroom
without someone standin by it
No I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

Hi  My name is.. what  My name is.. who
Hi  My name is.. huh  My name is.. what

Ahem.. excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class 
for one second

Eminem
Hi kids  Do you like violence  Yeah yeah yeah
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids  Uh huh
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did  Yeah yeah
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is  Huh
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight
but I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate  Ummmm..
And Dr. Dre said, Slim Shady you a basehead
Uh uhhh  So why's your face red  Man you wasted
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut  Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

Eminem
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of papers  Owwwwwwww
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin over pedestrians
in a spaceship while they screamin at me: LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS
Ninety nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do  Damn
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her  Oh thank you
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans  Aaahhhhhh
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
Dude, can I get your autograph
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE'

Eminem
Stop the tape  This kid needs to be locked away  Get him
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die  Fuck that
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Huh yup  Am I comin or goin  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka    dare me to drive  Go ahead
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
Whoops  Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk  hachhh too
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks  C'mere
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM  WAH
YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS  WAHHH
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
Put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head  BANG
I'm steamin mad  Arrrggghhh 
And by the way when you see my dad  Yeah
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..

Eminem as 'Stan'
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up  Man how's your daughter
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

Eminem as 'Stan'
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad   I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
four hours and you just said, No.
That's pretty shitty man   you're like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver   you said if I'd write you
you would write back   see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan    P.S.
We should be together too

Eminem as 'Stan'
Dear Mister I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans,
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word   I don't deserve it
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive
You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late   I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped  ALL  of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out

Eminem
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
I say that shit just clownin dogg,
c'mon   how fucked up is you
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad  Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
Damn

Look.. if you had.. one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted.. in one moment
Would you capture it.. or just let it slip  Yo..

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's chokin, how Everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out, time's up, over   BLAOW
Snap back to reality, OHH   there goes gravity
OHH   there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't
Give up that easy nope, he won't have it
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so sad that he knows 
when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
back to the lab again, yo, this whole rap shit
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better   lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better   lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better..

Soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
close to post mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da dah

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
fact that I can't get by with my nine to
five and I can't provide the right type of
life for my family, cause man, these God damn
food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed plus, teeter totter
Caught up between bein a father and a primadonna
Baby momma drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot, another day of monotony
has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
to formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin option, failure's not
Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Shady, Aftermath
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole
I think I'm losing control

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fuucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, plastered, puke drink throw up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings
Knowin I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this Biyitch is gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg in to sing some shit

Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't beleive
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, see em dropped
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you byye
Look real close cause strobe lights lie

We bout to have a party turn the music up
Let's get it started Go head shake your butt
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everday she be givin it up

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygentist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this flouride rininse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
Yeah me and Nate d o double g
Looking for a couple biyitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbuly, we finna finna have a party

Have a party turn the music up
Let's get it started Go head shake your butt
I'm lookin for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol slut
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now I

Bridge: Eminem
I'ma hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Cmon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Cmon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everday she be givin it up

There she goes, shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole
I think I'm losing control 

Eminem
These ideas are, nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
to see him walkin around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about, his fuckin dad walkin out
Cause he just hates him so bad that he, blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin back
Talkin black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants; doo rags and a stockin cap
His step father hit him so he, socked him back
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go

C'mon Sing with me Sing
Sing for the year Sing it
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear C'mon
Sing it with me, Just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away...

Eminem
Entertainment is changin, intertwinin with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unnholy, only have one homie
Only this gun   lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
or they can degrate; or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin on corners and porches just rappin
to havin a fortune, no more kissin ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin to me religiously
So I'm signin CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin menace this shit doesn't make sense B
It's all political, if my music is literal
and I'm a criminal how the FUCK can I raise a little girl
I couldn't; I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera   that was a FIST that hit you

Eminem
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols
and they want to get one cause, they think the shit's cool
Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it How we can come from practically nothin
to bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine
Who post pin up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night wishin they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin to you   but we're the fuckin shit in they eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits live on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...

Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks  > Obie Trice

Two trailer park girls go round the outside;
round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside;
round the outside, round the outside

Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back

I've created a monster, cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver huh
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when I'm not co operating
When I'm rockin the table while he's operating hey
You waited this long, now stop debating
Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovu lating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, FUCK YOU DEBBIE

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty, without me

Little Hellions, kids feelin rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin like prisoners helpless
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells BITCH
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my ass; you asked for me
Well I'm back, na na na na na na na na na na
enter in, endin up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent You sent for me

A tisket a tasket, I go tit for tat with
anybody who's talkin this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby  You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno
Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
But sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm dis gus ting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
to do black music so selfishly
and used it to get myself wealthy
Hey There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me

Chem hie la la la, la la la la la

Eminem Kids

Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down..

Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
We're toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never 'sposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin toe to toe with the Benzino
It don't matter I'd never drag 'em in battles that I can handle
'less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song, and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy somethin I helped build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
And that was just out of respect, for not runnin my mouth
And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, now I'm talkin a man
who literally saved my life, like fuck it I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
I'm still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute, because

There used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme and
wouldn't have to worry about, one of your people dyin
But now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck him, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came up
was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it, has got a grudge against me for nothin
Well fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy bein pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder INC
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
that's willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than ANY award is
But I ain't tryin to have none of people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all, 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin
I'm just willin to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin
off at your jaws well then I can, cause frankly I'm sick of talkin
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause

Eminem
May I have your attention please
May I have your attention please
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up
We're gonna have a problem here..

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin her ass worse than before
they first were divorce, throwin her over furniture Ahh
It's the return of the... Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding, 
he didn't just say what I think he did, did he
And Dr. Dre said... nothing you idiots 
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement Ha ha
Look at him, walkin around grabbin his you know what
Flippin the you know who,  Yeah, but he's so cute though
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel don't they
We ain't nothing but mammals.. Well, some of us cannibals
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up

Eminem
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records;
well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird
Why  So you guys could just lie to get me here
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
You little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee hee
I should download her audio on MP3 
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
And there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing but not quite me

Eminem
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin you 
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
in front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it 
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
It's funny; cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin home flirting
Pinchin nurses asses when I'm jackin off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin
He could be workin at Burger King, spittin on your onion rings
Screaming I don't give a fuck 
with his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go

Eminem
Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up

Eminem
Yeah...
I know sometimes, things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you
Straighten up little soldier   stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin about  You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
when I'm gone but I'm tryin to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin, wipe them tears, daddy's here no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney, Uncle's crazy ain't he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got it this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
I try to keep up sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
the harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things growin up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein
together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin that we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold, ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em weren't from me, cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom, was savin money for you in a jar
Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
on the Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
and met Dr. Dre, and flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seein daddy on the TV
And momma didn't like it, and you and Laney were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscin
Lookin at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it don't it
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

Eminem
And if you ask me to daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad
Ha ha

Meet Eddie, twenty three years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
he decides to rob a liquor store.
I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play...
Shit is mine, I gotta do this.. gotta do this

Dr. Dre
Alright, stop  Huh
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence  But who are you
I'm your motherfuckin conscience

Eminem
That's nonsense
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay 
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with an aged razor blade

Dr. Dre
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns

Eminem
Fuck that  Do that shit  Shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit  Are you that rich
Why you give a fuck if she dies  Are you that bitch
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids

Dr. Dre
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it  You're right
Not over this shit  Stop Drop the biscuit  I will
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
You know what Dre  I don't like your attitude..

It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute
Mmm, I don't know
Look baby..
Damn
Yo, it's gonna be alright, right
Well OK..

Meet Stan, twenty one years old.  Give me a kiss
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play...  Shit

Eminem
Now listen to me, while you're kissin her cheek
and smearin her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe..
Yo  This girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair
Yo, look at her bush.. does it got hair  Uh huh
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie _Kids_
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail..

announcer
Meet Grady, a twenty nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
he walks in the door of his trailer park home
to find his wife in bed with another man.
WHAT THE FUCK
Grady

Dr. Dre
Alright calm down, relax, start breathin..

Eminem
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin
While you at work she's with some dude tryin to get off
FUCK slittin her throat, CUT THIS BITCH'S HEAD OFF

Dr. Dre
Wait  What if there's an explanation for this shit
What  She tripped  Fell  Landed on his dick
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

Eminem
Okay  Thought about it, still wanna stab her
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped DEE BARNES

Dr. Dre
What'chu say  What's wrong   Didn't think I'd remember
I'ma kill you motherfucker

Eminem
Uhhh aahh  Temper temper
Mr. Dre  Mr. N.W.A.
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent

Dr. Dre
Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that.. aw fuck it...
What am I sayin  Shoot em both Grady, where's your gun at  

Where's my snare
I have no snare in my headphones   there you go
Yeah.. yo, yo

Eminem
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against
I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin kid that's behind
all this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's explodin
Tempers flarin from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin
Not takin nothin from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin
Keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evenin
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma
I'ma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleanin out my closet one more time
I said I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleanin out my closet

Eminem
Ha I got some skeletons in my closet
and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
before I ever had a multi platinum sellin CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
but I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cuz I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

Eminem
Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
witnessin your momma poppin prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin that someone's always goin throuh her purse and shit's missin
Goin through public housin systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
doesn't it Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma
But guess what You're gettin older now and it's cold when your lonely
And Nathan's growin up so quick he's gonna know that your phony
And Hailie's gettin so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her   she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song   keep tellin yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch; I hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
Well guess what, I  AM  dead   dead to you as can be

NO OTHER PRE RELEASE LYRICS ACCEPTED

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor

Alright stop, pajama time

Come here little kiddies on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusates
Ah ah ah ah ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
To the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it
Give a little poot poot, it's ok
Oops my CD just skipped

Everyday's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kind of breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin'
All I know is when I ger there someone's gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out yeah
Now what's ya name girl, what's ya sign
Man you must be up out yo mind

They say I was runnin' butt naked
Down the street screamin' ah ah ah ah
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said Save it, boy we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady touch my body
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It's real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality, look it's B. Rabbit
Oh you signed me up to battle I'm a grown man
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba
I don't have any lines to go right here so tubba
Tellytubby fellas what fellas what 
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous what
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm callin' all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor

My own words I guess...

Eminem
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you
What happens when you become the main source of a pain
Daddy look what I made, Dad's gotta go catch a plane
Daddy where's Mommy I can't find Mommy where is she
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka by baby...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

Eminem
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
You're making Mommy cry, why Why is Mommy crying
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're lying
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy   no stop it
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These stinkin' walls must be talking, cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying You've got one more chance to do right   and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...

Eminem
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden
I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
I get the point   fine, me and Mommy are gone
But baby wait, it's too late Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream Die Shady and pump it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say..

instrumental for the first 0:19 of this song

Eminem as 'Stan'
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; eff it, what's been up  Man how's your daughter
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her  I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground stuff that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the stuff you did with Rawkus too, that sh... was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
Oh I can't see at all
And even if I could it would all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
Not so bad..

Eminem as 'Stan'
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad   I just think it's messed up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
for four hours and you just said, No
That's pretty crummy man   you're like his favorite idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver   you said if I'd write you
you would write back   see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin in your songs
so when I have a crummy day, I drift away and put 'em on
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan    P.S.    we should be together too

Eminem as 'Stan'
Dear Mister I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word   I don't deserve it
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive
You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drownin
Now it's too late   I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped  ALL  of your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you go to sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shoot, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this tape out

Eminem
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that sh... intentionally just to diss you
But what's this stuff you said about you like to cut your wrists too
I say that stuff just clownin dawg, c'mon   how messed up is you
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselin
to help your ass from bouncin off the walls when you get down some
And what's this junk about us meant to be together
That type of crap'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad  Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy bit
Some dude was drunk and drove this car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
Damn

Eminem
Nothing can stop and nothing can change
And you better just make new livin' arrangments
If you think, you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no  brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or damn get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought up as that
Not even the same leage as Jay Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
The name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the Radi O
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And they very well maybe
The same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip hop legends which is amaze me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big ba big big bay ba baby

Obie Trice
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryin to get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately, my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

Eminem SHAAADDYYYSTAT QUOWe're back

Stat Quo
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed my kids
Would it fulfill all my family needs c'mon
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I recieve
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him suck my dick
I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin, where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it drink my pee
Record song for the Detox LP
Feet don't fail he
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'ma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me
A towns auntre, Aftermath, Shady

Eminem SHAAADDYYYBOBBY CREEKWe're back

Bobby Creekwater
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that aint right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a shofurr because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the apitomee
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin through the track
Nigga

Eminem SHAAADDYYYCA$HIS

Ca$his
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been toa function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'ma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro sac, D's and E Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga

Eminem   SHAAADDYYYHa I Told You We Was Back

Eminem O. Trice, c'mon

Obie Trice
Yeah, niggaz got me
I'ma get 'em, it ain't over

You can catch me in the whip with a fifth of pimp juice yeah
And I'm poppin the clip, 'bout to fix this issue woo
You pray that I don't hit, I ain't equipped to miss you no
You're gonna need an ambulance to stitch your tissue nigga
Or either have a bag on your hip to shit through ha
You seen us on the ave, ain't just to get you
But my penis is a mag, when I lift it hits you DA DA DA DA DA
Cause I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

Obie Trice
I, solemnly swear on my, daughter's tears
The nigga that got him in the head will feel it before the year ends
That's right Hope you inconspicuous, my friend
Cause once the word get back you in a world of sin sin
Bullets will hurdle at him, for tryin to murder what's
been determined as the first solo African me
To go platinum where the accident happened at
But maggots I'm alive with vengeance to get back get back
My momma blood pressure was affected from that
My lil' girl need her daddy on the phone at a certain time
Exact now, and niggaz act wild foul
But when the mac come out, y'all niggaz ex' out blaow
And I don't wanna hear X Y Z
I'm X'in out your whole entity for tryin to kill me me nigga
Filthy motherfuckers, I'll show you what real be real be nigga
When these H T B's light up your kidneys woo
I'm so sincere, you see in a hearse this year
This is Obie hearin clear, niggaz beware
We're comin at you with firearms in air yeah nigga
And your purpose so superfluous
How could I be merciful when murkin me's a mercenary's goal uh
Nigga I got paper, I'll have ya ass urgently exposed what
No emergency's bringin back your souls
Slugs shatter your bones for pat pattin me in the dome
Learn this patter in, we catch him at home, he wrong
That's when automatics sporadically catch him in the abdomen
Another  Dirty  motherfucker's gone YEAH

Second Round's on Me robbin, shootin, killin, murder

Kuniva
I stumble in the club blowed up, nine millimeter cocked
something's telling me to stop, fuck it I don't see the cops
Nigga's don't believe until they see it's out
stupid motherfuckers want to take the scenic route, now the heater's out
Bitches scream like I pulled my penis out
beggin' me to put that big motherfucker away, but the demon's out
Everybody on the floor, come out of that 
Come out of them diamonds and you come out of that velour
matter of fact turn it back up shit I could use it ohhhhh
I need the noise in case I have to let a couple off
saw another icey chain, walked over and tugged it off
Give me that butter soft, and since you buyin' out the bar
you can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow
I'm out for the paper, my homie better hide the jewels
I'm in the game starvin, and I ain't playin buy the rules nigga

Boom boom chuck, boom b boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up
Boom boom chuck, boom b boom chuck
Boom boom chuck, b boom, Shady

There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, This music is in us, and it's
Not over 'till we say it's finished and G Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh shock the world, what to do next
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre zy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass
50 Cent

Nah, Em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass, the clean parts, the shitty parts
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the Fif'll tell you're ass apart
A came in this game, crush a motherfuckers from tha start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich, bitch
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick
Teflon wrapped on, case I get clapped on
D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home
Still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows
You're rockin with the kid that spit sicka sick flows
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
E'eryday Dre day, front and cause a maylay
Turn the town upside down wit a frown upside down
I smile through sumthin' fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm fuckin' with strict stacks, I'm kickin' you stripped fats
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back

Boom boom chuck, boom b boom chuck

Eminem
When me and Fif got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemesis is your nemesis
Ain't for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When there's beef you jus' gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin the most current people on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs til it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So is Shady Aftermizzath back in that ass You izzask
Come izzon, what kind of fizzucked up quizzestion is 'at

Pistol play ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleeding J.F.K

I'll ride to the death, do you rep that way
Forever ima be a Shady 7 4 gangsta
Plus I survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin in all beef
You keep talking shit now the squad called me

Lloyd Banks
Enough holdin back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa queen mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin G
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin bitch magnet
Spit it how I love it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it

Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care
You can be black white or albino yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co sign no shit
You can just keept making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit
Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast
From out of nowhere you might find your career

See us on the award shows and we're like OH YEAH
Can we get more of those they like OH YEAH
See us keep blowing up we're like OH YEAH
So Jimmy can crack corn but i don't care

See me in the videos i'm like OH YEAH
See me ride up close your like OH EAH
And where's D12 at they like WE OVER HERE
And where the fuck we goin we're like NOWHERE

Eminem
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit let them talk shit cuz they talk shit
Knowing deep down they really just wanna squash it
Cuz no one wants to walk around steppining dog shit
And get doo doo on their shoe again as soon as they wash it
But the pride won't let em inside they like go get em
And I'm just like why you trying to fight momentum
We just keep winning by landslides oh an um
Shady Limiteds in any size yo denim to velour
Even our clothing lines on fire
As 50 would said our clothing lines on FIRE
Meanwhile your mind's on us like mine's on Mariah

My life is trapped in these line's, that's why I'm packin these nine's

Lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like soda, hold up

Slow up
This gun is loaded
Roll up

If Em say it, I spray it, if he will it, I kill it
We kill packs to get iller in Detroit, hope y'all can feel it
Real as this gun on my waistline, and woah we don't waste time
Ja mad he can't take a punch and 50 can take nine
We got school craft here at the 7, 8, and text her
I'm up in Holly, spendin' dollas, ain't feelin' no pressure
Yes sir, your texture is bitch, betcha' you flinch
When Proof shoot up they coupe, and waste your whole clique

Gun totin hazardous cutthroat, canteloupe can split it
And the Pope couldn't prevent me from shittin on niggaz
Fitted caps get blew back like bad wind, imagine backspinnin

A hell raiser, I smack the skin off your man's face

WHAT Whatever you want, we providin it diligently
PUMP Double barrel wherever we go willingly
DUMPIN On opposition in the streets or industry

Kon Artis a.k.a. Mr. Porter
You was born I was hatched, but you came out deformed
I have nuts of a horse, and you ain't got no balls
Come runnin with tec 9's whenever niggaz would call
Bang bang bang, bang bang, shoot up classway halls
I don't give a FUCK, who you call to come
You came with thirty niggaz, I only came with one
That just goes to show you how much scrap a nigga got in me
You gone off Henny, that liquid courage drivin you into these
situations you in, don't get that Purple Pills shit confused
with us bein cool up here singin My Band
I'm sure you see these little kids cryin over me man
They'll do anything for a fuckin autograph

I'll show you the meanin of die hard fans
Saddam Hussein who sews, who radical act
A mechanical bomb attached to my pelvis
That's what I mean by get, back; I mean get, back
Or find your head detached from that Mitchell & Ness

I guess I'm just too fresh, to finish that line
Denaun's ain't next

Ca$his
Uh, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We're renegades, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We're renegades, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hit me up mayn

You the pussy ass nigga livin next to the killer
I'm the killer that moved out of the block
And head back to the hood, when I'm movin my rock
You can find me, on a dark road, dark clothes
Lle', in the console and God knows I make grip off blow
Shit   I could get rich off blows
My nation affiation pitch forks I've chose
What the fuck you gon' do We bang back hammers
I'm a six point star, in a gray bandanna
I'd die for this, nigga you rhyme for this
Pussy I ride for this, and did time for this
That's why I'm convinced you fear, that I'm convicted
Until elevens in soaps, and some gangsta shit man
Guess who gorillas leave tats infragments
Two shots through your cabbage, and gas from Ca$h

Pussy niggaz always talkin that shit
What you flaggin, who you bangin with I don't give a fuck
You can live in the hood and shit
But remember who you bangin with I don't give a fuck
Pussy niggaz talkin all that shit
What you flaggin in your bangin whip I don't give a fuck
You can live in the hood and shit
But remember who you bangin with cause I don't give a fuck

Ca$his
Tip our levels and scarce piece, a meal beast
We'll creep one deep, slump seat, dump heat
Niggaz scream Fuck me he lucky, when I blast it
I left respect enough for an open casket
Way to go Ca$his, boost up my ego
Let loose, out sunroof with my Eagle
Folk of the century, rollin with peoples
The omen the sequel, the more they will see you
Close kin, molotov close to no skin
His momma pretends that she doesn't, know him
I'm the reason, for the whole Say No slogan
Doped in folk and loc'ed if provokin
Got a brand new thing, with the scope in
Leave your family, with the wake for hostin
I'll collect enough snow, 'til my hands the Aspens
I'm the realest nigga 'round here, ask for Ca$his folk

Ca$his
Loadin the cup folk, loadin it up tote
Hang fire up I, choke from the gun smoke
That's on the boss mayn, my Nina Ross came
Place gangbangers, into a coffin
This is renegades, Rick not really paid
Gave Ca$h pistols, now they milli sprayed
Full bricks of raw, nigga that's really weight
While my workers foldin, now that's really cake
Give it right back to 'em, watch it regenerate
I'm a degenerate black bandit, livin ape
Niggaz dig in they pockets like DJ's dig in crates
If you cuttin my profits, you gon' in to dish some cake
Heckler Koch and, glass and vodka
I'm the independent kingpin, cocaine Koch
Fo' thieve blow weed, plus sold O Z
Niggaz never son me, I was born O.G. fo'

Obie Trice

Ca$his
Geah, Ca$his know
Shady Records, the dream team, uh

Sittin in the back of the, all gray Acura
Gun to the passenger for actin tough
Turn the wheel in the passin, heart of an assassin
Plus I'm on the draw down, quick as fuck
Last move 'fore I give all street shit up
Put a nigga in the ground face down, feet up
This nigga here tried to cuff me for my re up
When I went to his crib he called police up
Now you on the way to bein paraplegic
for sendin messages through bitches like you go see us
Shady, Ca$h king of the dope fiends plus
Give 'em a square mile by blocks and I'm creamed up
Took the bullet out of Obie head, put it in my pistol
and use it, ammunition on the niggaz they hit
Damn, I go to war on the regular man
Cause I'm part of the dream team, you a regular man
Far as rap I don't see no competitors and
you see things like me, with my medal in hand
I'm a state case boy with a federal plan
A hundred in beats, beatin the shit out skinheads
I'm the spirit of a G bringin lyrics of the street
I'm Ca$his, a real dope boy on the beat beat
Slumped in the seat tucked clutchin the heat
Basically, you niggaz can't fuck with me, hah

We run this shit, fo' five on the hip
Out to ride for Shady, yeah
Y'all niggaz ain't hard, y'all niggaz ain't real

Out to ride for Shady

Obie Trice
Yeah, Trice is back on the Alche' track
With Ca$his, capitalizin on this mic in fact
We fuckin with the captain of rap
My nigga with the Nike cap keep the continuity quite exact
So allure your cats into the second classic
We're mature as the number uno aspect, as yet
Who's to pass the driver
O tries to flow to die fo' and the death blow survive woo
I echo through your external vibe
with internal experiences I've acquired uhh
I'm probably the most honest hip hopper alive
A victim depictin images from my own eyes yeah
Never livin through homes, why
Homie got his own set of cajones, stand up guy
It's Ca$his, O. Tri', rappers we blow by
This is as accurate as the masses will have it, no lie

An executive mindframe, fuck tryin to rap
Niggaz represent a corner, I refined the map
Artesian water, this is flow untapped
And rep for 'em like Mike on playoff night; that's if the payoff right
The dream team, Bobby Creek, Em, 50 and them
We  Run the City  like Diddy and them
The opposition we just pityin them, it's no chance
Put you niggaz in the special olympics is no dance
I'm nice like a meal twice, nigga no grams
Get them bitches out they pants, I did it with no hands
See, one thing's for sure I'm pure uncut
Baby you can either stay down or get gunned up
Mr. Night Life, I can give you niggaz sun up
I just get an order, let my niggaz pick the gun up
That's one up on ya, nigga wake yo' punk ass up
This is ammonia, fuck your face up
Bitches won't even telephone ya
I can space age pimpin, a pocket full of stone ya
Ya dig  Take the world over that's the gig
Sell enough units have Paul and Jimmy dancin the jig
Roll the Maserati through the city, me and Riggs
Bumpin Obie Trice, shoot a bird at the pigs
Ever since a nigga got rich
Life is still a bitch but she a high class bitch
I just wanna fuck with me a high class bitch
Nigga pitch that on some eyeglass shit
See I classic, enough to get the mics back right
And I'm a fan of record sales, I don't like that hype
I'm here to end it

Oh Lord that nigga mean, ain't he
Yea, goddamn that nigga clean, ain't he
Yea, see he a greedy baby
But some people tend to call him the return of Shady
There he is   goddamn that nigga clean, ain't he
Yea, oh Lord that nigga mean, ain't he
Yea, see he a greedy baby
But some people tend to call him the return of Shady
Bobby Creek, Bobby Creek...

Yea, yeah
Nice like Mike right, you niggaz soft as night lights
Diamond's a tall order I'm just tryin to get the hype right
I'm throwed off, so hard, so soft, sold out
Bought the Coupe a color of nice weather and rolled out
I can't hold out, hot like a fish fried
Who the fuck is this guy The ruler on the disc I
Hit you in your suit coolers, I'm in the Coupe cooler
than pigskin men base runners and hoop shooters
A loose screw ban money like the legendary Roots crew
This is just the shit that I am used to
Oh nah, I don't bust a chopper but I used to
Now I put the word out   I'm sure you niggaz heard 'bout
Young boss sold money, old school new paint
Ball knowin you can't, give a fuck what you think
Member of the mighty Shady Records, nigga you ain't
Think you fuckin with me then double whatever you drink
You can't fathom what the bitch throwin at him
Couple niggaz hatin on him but the fans waitin on him
like a, PlayStation 3, money for your advance
My vacation fee, ain't no use in hatin me nigga
And don't shit talk pimp, I'd rather flush
anyone with big enough nuts to come and fuck with us
I bust but keep in mind, pressure bust pipes
And you niggaz wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
What the fuck yeah

Akon Shady, Konvict, Upfront...

I feel you creepin I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gulatto
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend ya over
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ohhh oh ohh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ohhh oh ohh

Akon
Shorty if you wanna ride you can ride on me
We can bump heads and collide on me
Want beef, damn right can rely on me
To bring that Campbell like Naomi
Just pull that girl and take it on easy
Lookin all oiled up and all greasy
Bout that time you stop that teasin
Way that you drop done got me here cheesin
What's funny is that you takin
all my money for real
I rather spend it on you
Right now than my homie's bail
And I can see that's what you're made fo'
And ain't ever been no lame ho
With that booty bought and paid fo'
Won't move 'til you on my payroll

Stat Quo
Yeah, yeah, Stat Quo Ahhh
I love when you do it girl move to it like you're used to it
Drop it down I wanna put my thang through it
To the crib we go, go fast and slow
Make it twirl like a stripper slide down my pole
Shawty ass so swole got your boy like whoa
One night with me now she wanna marry Stat Quo
But I'm like no, let's keep it on the low
On occasion let me come through and tap that hole
Make you lose control and all her girls know
that I hit it right at night, I'm a pro
I only come 'round and get sexual
if she flexible and bisexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if, only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that, murk that, work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine
Stat Quo, YEA

Bobby Creekwater
Yeah, it's Bobby Creek, know'msayin
The ice in the watch reflects the light to her
The money quite green and the ice light bluer
The swag might kill her so I said good night to her
She don't want me to leave I can see right through her
So we, dipped out, burn one trip out
Get low like Caribbean limbo
Didn't go out like light, baby girl get right
Head so swole my hat don't fit right
We can cruise in the car or we could take flight
The middle of the night, make your body  8  like
Mike Vick  against the Eagles
Call myself a king cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care, listen baby it's a fact that
if you drop back I'ma quarterback sack that
We can go deep and I can shark attack that
Say you don't remember where your keys and your hat at

Eminem
Hello
What up
Hello Yo, I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you back

I sense someone's tapping into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon
The FBI might be trying to pull my file soon
I might be walking blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
Right outside the window of my living room
And if they do you can say good night and by bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth of walking dead man
Blank stair, dead pan, look on my face as I gaze into space
As I wait to be scooped up in that van
As I mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gonna say a sniper just appeared out of nowhere
And I'll go down in the history
As the bloodsucking leech who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dying the villian, not the hero
Splendid, stupendous way to end this, I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flash back to September 7th when 2Pac was murdered in Vegas
He said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it
Should we ever live to regret it
Like that day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By the greatest lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block in the library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know, or do they
Who's they, for 'em to say, touche'
We're all vulnerable and its spook ay
This is about as kook ay, as I've ever felt now
Count down to nuclear meltdown
7,6,54,321
You can run, you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nothing
When its time, it's your time
You are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy #1

This, is.. an exclusive, remix
Eminem Remix

50 Cent
Yeah, I'm tryin to catch me somethin
A little jux or somethin

Nigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me
Take that shit off, move I'll break you off properly

You wan' spray at me go 'head; the last nigga that tried
got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your lil' sister callin me stupid, reason why
her and your momma in the living room now hogtied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand new cig in that ol' 38
I be schemin to put a lil' bread on my plate
Watch and dress shirts, stomp through a hole in the cake
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really want it you pussy  Bitch please
This is stashhouse, jackpot, there go them ki's
My black G Unit hoodie just wreak with marijuana
Cocaine comin out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah nigga, YEAH

I get mine the fast way, the ski mask way
Make money, make money money money
Nigga if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money money money

Who's that peepin in my window
WOW   the feds on me now
They know when I'm sleepin, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapped, I'm screamin fuck Jake
I'm tryin to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA   now that sounds great
I see niggaz with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waitin to get fucked
I holla at A.I. peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two macs
Then I'm back doin me, back out on the spree
Catch me and niggaz slippin out pumpin that D
Get me a little crew I'll have 'em pumpin for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name, in NY they don't know where I be
Yeah a nigga doin dirt, but a nigga low key

Obie Trice
Niggaz didn't kill me, now a nigga's gone yeah

Sippin Dom Perignon while she sippin up them newborns
Yeah, bet ya hate the news holmes nigga
He probably somewhere, sippin on a stoop, huh
Sippin on a brew, plottin to pop me later huh haha
When will a hater learn I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner, send weight to the coroner
When courage make him turn performer
I transform into Uma Therman, a dude's version
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed in hip hop, watch out my services that's right
Yet, you tried to murder this nigga that's comin
from the same turf as you's NIGGA what nerve of you's NIGGA
Pissed cause your hustles ain't worth a shit NIGGA
I'm gettin rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's, dig
With a bitch you in the trenches tryin to reach it big ah ha
On another rapper's dick who don't represent where you live DUMMY
Know you're annoyed but don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga, not an Accord woo
I'm in that Honda G4 you would never afford woo
And yep, it's probably ease when a nigga is on board

Kuniva
I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst   and what can be worse
The streets is like a curse, niggaz frontin for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggaz lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

Bobby Creekwater
Yo, Obie, they gonna fuck with us this time nigga B G O V
Uh, Bobby Creek, nigga

Laugh now, cry never, my beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggaz this evenin
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch Quit playin
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggaz, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin when he said you gon' be fine nigga

Eminem Ca$his

Ca$his
Witness the art of war, in the physical geah
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical uhh c'mon
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction what
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissin you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
is to move up, pull towards you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin to Proof, I'm  Searching for Jerry Garcia 
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin the K, at hawk niggaz waitin on me
You take the first shot then,  Second Round's on Me 
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scraps to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed deranged and more famous
than clappin down bangers meant, for entertainment, geah

Stat Quo
Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke YEA
Lookin like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggaz
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four wheelers
God shill us, from back stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you COPY
You COPY

Tony Yayo Shady, Shady

There is no escaping,
There's no place to hide
You scream someone save me
But they don't pay no mind
Goodnight, goodbye

You're walking down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the morning and you're in a nightmare
It's horrible, right there's the coroner
Waiting for you to turn the corner so he can corner ya, you're a goner
He's onto ya, out the corner of his cornea, he just saw you run
All ya want is to rest cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowing a Klonopin while I'm nodding in and out on the ottoman 
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's with, blood all over me
Dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must have just blacked out again, not again

It's 3 A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must have killed 'em, killed 'em
I said...

Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the Aloe and Lanolin
Bust all over the wall panelling
Dismantling every candle, on top of the fireplace mantling
Grab my flannel and my bandana then kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standing in my front window, would you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causing illusions again, brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end, phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused, days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules to me, what am I gon' do
Hey the prodigal son, the diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them

It's 3 A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must have killed 'em, killed 'em
I said...

Bridge x2
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I dump and I slash, slice and gash last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that much fun
Off a half pint of the Jack, my last Vic' and a half
A Fleshlight of Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights, pushed him into the stinking tub
Cut him up into pieces and just when I went to drink his blood
I thought I ought to drink his bath water, that ought to be fun
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery son
Your bloodcurdling screams, just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 A.M. and here I come, so you should probably run 
A secret passageway around here, man there's gotta be one
Oh no, there's probably none, he can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs, there ain't no stopping me from chopping him up, up
Cause it was..

It's 3 A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must have killed 'em, killed 'em
I said...

Eminem
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'til one night he snucked in and said
We're goin out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
Can we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head, 
bust a nut, get some rest
The next day, my mother said,
I don't know what the fuck's UP with this kid
The bastard won't even eat nothing, he's scared
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead
Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's fakin it, I bet you
I bet he probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this, of course, unless you object
Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head

If you count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed, not under my faucet
Then you would know I completely lost it
Is he nuts    NO, he's insane

Eminem
Are you in Naw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin blades off
Ate the blades, cut the baseball and the slingshot
Then the aimed at his own face, let the thang popped
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants and took EVERY fuckin thing off
Everything but his tanktop and his training bra
Ain't he raw Yeah, maniac, that Shady dawg
Man, that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he, dawg
Shady dawg, what be goin through that fuckin brain of yours
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin for Sing along...

Eminem
Don't you know what felch means Yeah Well, then tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching
Burp, belch, then go back for a second helping
Could you dig what I'm sayin, man Could you smell me
I want you to feel like my stepfather felt me uhmm...
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelpin
Shady, what the fuck you saying I don't know   HELP ME
What the fuck's happening I think I'm fucking MELLLTING
Marshall, I just love you boy, I care about your well being
NO, dad I said NO I don't need no help ing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me her a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X, and they called it Pubic Hair on Chelsea
Well, this is called 'Ass Rape' and we're shooting the jail scene

It's so nice to meet you...It's been a long time... Sorry I've been away so long... 
My name is, Shady... I never meant to leave you

You see that chick in the gym, checkin' me out
Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill, and I'm wrecklessly reckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now
There's the neckless I lost, clingin' to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh jackpot, yeah, open sesame mouth
Down the hatch, and the feelin' you can't match it
I rat tat tat on your door with the damn ratchet
Att ack tack tacking a whore with the damn hatchet
A napsack pack with like 40sumn Xanax's
Shorty come back, I'm tryna score me some lap dances
Cause I'm bout to relapse, so baby pour me some Jack Daniels
Forumla 44D and 40's with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back atcha

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And are you menstruating baby, my lil' friends waitin' to say Hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booties shakin' like jello
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

Yeah
My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people gimmie um
It just becomes everyday, extra curriculum
No reason inparticular, it was strictly fun
a 5th of trone and 2 bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me hun, but what is your name, Vivienne
I woke up next to ya naked and err, did we um
Of course we did, but didn't I strap a jimmy hun
I'm looking for the torn rapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm tryna keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run
Like Speedy Gonzales, Alistar see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's I'm fiendin' for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And do ya happen to have anything on ya to make my mood mellow
Some are opal and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurtin' me to know I'll be closin' that curtain for good
Word, word, word, word, word, word, word
I second that and a third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free, 100 bucks for these percodans
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully searched the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurting him
Tirelessly on the phone trying to russle up, muscle relaxants
For his back, and a couple of blacksons, now he's doubling backwards
And he's stumbling back, slipped and fell, hit his back bone
Heard something go crack, Now he's up in the bathroom
Like he's busting a nap, almost ended it that soon
Because of the fact, I'm just busting my own chops
While I'm busting a rap, resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it I'm back

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And do ya happen to have anything on ya to make my mood mellow
Some are opal and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

It's so nice to meet you...It's been a long time... Sorry I've been away so long... 
My name is, Shady... I never meant to leave you

Yo same song and dance
Damn girl everywhere I go, same song and dance
I like the way you move all over the globe, same song and dance
Something about it man same song and dance
In the pale moonlight yo

Eminem
I'm lookin at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
the whole rapper thing, aren't ya
Probably thinkin you'll get slapped so dang hard ya
won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya
Couple rape charges people think you're a monster
The police constantly buggin you non stop
I walk up on ya, well hello Tonya
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas Do you got a flat
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundry mat, I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
and sit up front, I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no masks for this attack
I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take taskforce to get you back, c'mon

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got
Give it your all, look at you bawl, why you cryin to me
Same song and dance

Eminem
The first victim I had she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every 4 to 6 months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in son
Look here she comes, I'd better pull out the big guns
Hello Lindsay, you're lookin a little thin hon
How 'bout a ride to rehab Get in cunt
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl I'm just kidding, let me start over again hon
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wencher, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you it would've already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to
lynch her with 66 inches of extension, cord

Eminem
My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played the little schoolgirl when she first
burst up on the scene, it seemed that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, 
but what was really goin on was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons or
footage of me impalin myself on an elephant tusk
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos and just
Climb the gate and ring the bell like, Hello my love
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me
I'll share my Valium with you cause I'm feelin you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since the schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feelin you, ooh ooh girl you sexy little gal you
Hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to, make a new outfit outta you
New outfit Shit I'll make a suit outta you, shoot
Now show me how you move, baby do how a you do

Eminem
Same kickin and screamin, same cryin and sobbin
Same song and dance
Same beggin and pleadin, same yellin and bleedin
Same song and dance
Yeah, same song and dance
I know, same song and dance

Eminem
Guess who D'you miss me
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus

When you walked, through the door woo
It was clear to me clear to me
You're the one, they adore
Who they came to see who they came to see
You're a, rock star baby
Everybody wants you everybody wants you
Player ohh
Who can really blame you who can really blame you
We're the ones who made you

Eminem
Chka... ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zan tac, for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel Is it fantastic, is it grand
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady man, no, don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just cause he asked to put his hands
on her massive, gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can
Yes he can can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2, you're practically a 10
I know you want me girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl

Eminem
The enforcer, lookin for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and, Charlie horse her
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
have that I don't Are you tellin me tenderness
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler, and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby say hello to my little friend
Brit forget K Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
love with me John Mayer so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style but it isn't Slim

Eminem   singing
And that's why, my love, you'll never live, without
I know you want me girl cause I can see you're checkin me out
And baby, you know, you know you want, me too

Eminem
Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think that's bad you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal but
Jessica Alba, put her breasts on my mouth, blup
Wowzers, I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressin like Elvis
Lord help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Lookin like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can ya blame me You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake
with a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl

Eminem
So baby baby get down, down down
Baby get down, down down
Baby get down, down down
Baby get down, get down
Baby get down, down down
Baby get down, down down
Baby get down, down down
Baby get down, get down

Ohh Amy Rehab never looked so good
I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha ha, woo Dr. Dre 2020
Yeah

Ohh, my goodness What have I done
Oh no oh no I can't believe it believe it
It's like it's like
I've got the whole WORLD, in my palm in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

Eminem
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bi sexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten and twice shy, well lie next to
the guy with nine extasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ripped condoms in quantities, why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester
Dropkick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter then I guess I'll
dig her fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends

Eminem
All my Westside bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the deep end, sho' enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwin up
Man you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls Nicole you kiddin
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy gluing Madonna
to the La Z Boy sofa, fold her in two then sit on her
Imagine a visual for that man, who woulda thought I
could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeace
But the chick's so old she looks like she out lived a life sentence
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

Eminem
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man Grab hold of this branch
with both hands, man they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me   like it's my fault
his name rhymes with so many different words, jeez
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Always hated you and I still do
doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
Who do you think you are Hang my suit up in the armoire
Every day I hate you more and more, throw down the cardboard
Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore

Eminem
The world is mine the world is mine

Yea, yea yea
Follow me follow me
Come with me to the dark side, of the force force
No man would boldly go, to this place
The devil only knows, of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold
Oh so cold, ohh

Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever, don't ya Girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark stay wide awake
A world so dark, a world so cold
A world where on ly some will go stay wide awake
But none return, when will they learn
Where do they go God only knows stay wide awake

Eminem
Fe fi fo fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, put my car in park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider; hi there girl, you mighta
heard of me before, see whore, you're the kind of girl that I a 
ssault and rape and figure why not try not to make your pussy wider
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah now let's see her have triplets and I'll di 
sintegrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde 
hyde and cyanide, girl you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
No need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun outta
murder and I'd rather go vinn vinn and now you see just how the
fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uh
Shit wait a minute I mean skull, my knife seems dull, pull another one out, uhh

Eminem
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright ens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin me play hide and seek, like Jason I'm so hungry
She's naked see, no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient, see I try to be but gee, why does she taunt me
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front see
So blatantly but silently cause I know that she's sound sleep
Who's wakin me so violently and why's he on top of me
He's rapin me, she tries to scream, Somebody please get him off me
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughing like it's funny
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratchin like some dumb freak
Escapin me, no dice you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
or Satan, gee what a sight to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's all right with me, man life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancing to quite a different drumbeat

Eminem
Better try to stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep it's your soul I'ma try to take
Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement, now ya
must've just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler; bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how ya cower
Jump out on you now like I was Jawa from fuckin Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, beddy bye bye, beddy bye bye, it's time to die die
Oughta not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt, there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hackin 'em up with that
What was that Dial 9 1 1, someone's comin in from the back

Good evening, this is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of, 4 million and a half feet
That's 8 million miles in the sky
You are now free to smoke about the cabin, cabin, chka

Dr. Dre
I'm Dre from, back in the day from
N.W.A. from, black and the gray from
Chokin a bitch to, smackin her face from
Stackin up bodies to, rackin AK's up
From rackin up hits to, stackin them crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happenin in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, far as competition faggot there ain't none

Eminem
Speak of the devil it's attack of the Rainman
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrunn, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon, no one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny man it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A 1, so

One more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat, and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go   you are now smokin with the best, best, chka
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat, and scratch that break
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's gooo   you are now smokin with the best, best, chka

Eminem
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Takin lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again; naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high pussy bwoy I could spin
Vinn, vinn; fuck the handle I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench coach and throw it to him
There he goes in his trenchcoat, no clothes again
Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my fore a skin
Show me nipple, I'm pinch both and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse, if it's forced it's him
Don't fight the feelin if you're feelin the force within
Then when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain, so

Dr. Dre
Now where there's smoke there's fire, where there's fire there's flames
Where there's flames there's chronic, either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

Eminem
Nuh uh, he ain't playin
He's gon' get the AK and aim it right at your brai ain
I'm slightly insa ane, vodka and Creatine
Hypnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's giving me wings,  I Believe I Can Fly 
While I pee on the girl, you won't catch me C.S.I.
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake

Dr. Dre
Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you're smokin with the tried est and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rollin shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smokin, you just holdin shit up
Now here we go let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
Cause if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seein as how, I blew up off of puffin them trees

Eminem   Dr. Dre
Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up Cheech
C'mon, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is Earth calling, Shady man, come on back What
Man we're losin him, he won't even respond back, fuck
Now look at all the pretty women in here damn bitches
Dre it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit just
And give me

Yeah... Oh Yeah Yeah...Oh..
I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me, High
I smell something in the air that's making me, HIGH

Ok here we go, Do re mi fa so fa so la ti so
Lyrical rascal, kick back the tobasco
You motherfucker's must just not know the tic tac so
Time to show you the most kickass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pickaxe, a sick asshole
Tic tac toe comes with sixpack, with exact doe
Knives, strangling wives with dick lasso
3 bags of the grass, Zig Zags, I'm with the Doc so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to poison girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home my lil vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn, watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, not what you thought so
Bout time you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

It must be the Ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny, that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind

I said it's the Ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny, that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind

Your dreams are getting fulfilled, Ooh I'm literally getting a chill
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dalai Lama
And be calmer, bring drama a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me mama, you're looking sexy mama
Don't know if it's the lala, or the rum and Pepsi mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping, then next time I make a pizza
How many people you know that can name every serial killer
Who ever existed in a row, put them in chronological order
Beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they was stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which state they found her and how they attacked the victim
Say what murder weapon was used to do what on which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife and which nun
Don't stop, I like this it's fun, the fucking night's just begun

When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're trying to light
Behind the boards, it's Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a lint drum, make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome
The spinning drum when it comes to lyrics and penning some
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the ending of
Capable of winning her, bullets are, so unbelievable its a
Titanium cranium that's full of surprises
When the smoke rises, right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos high
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking

Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be, alone
Are you calling me Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me I'm reaching out, for you

Eminem
I'm just so fuckin depressed I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump but I need somethin to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or, why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin to feel distant again so I decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to vent but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow, but I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see, what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each other's minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautifulllll, oh ohh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to youuuuuu, so ohh oh
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautifulllll, oh ohh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to youuuuuu, so ohh oh

Eminem
Yeah
I think I'm startin to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room just as soon as
I walk in it's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens a door for conversation, like I want that
I'm not lookin for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin man servant tryin to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like HA
Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, goddamn
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes, and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

Eminem
Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of bein that cool kid, even if it meant actin stupid
Aunt Edna always told me, Keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue tryin to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where you're sittin is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

sample   Eminem
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own oh ohh
Everybody has a private world where they can be, alone so ohh oh
Are you calling me Are you trying to get through oh ohh
Are you reaching out for me I'm reaching out, for you so ohh oh

Yeah, to my babies, stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you them shoes, to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful
So ohh oh

numerous news reports
Breaking news, Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold out European tour
to check himself into rehab, after admitting an addiction
to sleep medication. We'll have more on this story as it develops.
Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently
survived a gunshot to the head, in what appears to be
a random drive by shooting. Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be...
alienated... on again/off again relationship with...
This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus...
Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire
at an after hours club we've learned that the rapper Proof
has been fatally shot.
Shady/Aftermath recording artist...
Long time best friend of Eminem, and a member of the rap group D12.
D12 back in the news again today...
Is it a sabbatical or the end The rumors and speculation
continue to swirl around Eminem. He insists he's just taking a break
but doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask,
'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up'

Eminem
So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But somethin changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me to a monster, I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert, I was rakin in the dough, rollin in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losin my freedom, there was nowhere for me
to not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in between
You either loved it or hate it, every CD critics gave it a 3
then three, years later they go back and re rate it
Then called The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic, The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later I'm still at it
Divorced, re married, a felon, a father, sleepin pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk

So be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten folllld
I said be careful what you wish forrrr
Cause you just might get it, and if you get it
then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it
Cause it might just come back on you ten folllld

Eminem
I got a letter from a fan that said, he's been prayin for me
Every day and for some reason it's been weighin on my mind heavy
Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But somethin told me to go ahead and open it
But, why would someone pray for you when they don't know you
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
at least, a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got, God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it
Just watchin it from a opposite standpoint, man boy's got to look
nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
right now on how, to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for cause I got the shit

You sick bastard, let me go
Somebody please Help
I don't wanna die Please help me
It fits, perfect

Eminem
Better watch out, sucka now I gotcha where I want ya
Onslaught, comin and I'm packin in my lunch a
bunch of, missile launchers and a bunch of contra 
ban, van full of ganja, now come on jump
Man stop, moshin Marshall, oh my God you're
doin the Cha Cha and the Cucaracha with a quadra 
plegic, boogeyin down to Frank Sinatra
Lindsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya
Who'da knew da Buddha'd do to me what it's done
Such cynicism when there's ism in my system
Blunt hypnotism, lift a spliff up to my lips son
So much on my hands I got to give my kids a fist bump
Christo pher Reeves swimmin in my swim trunks
Mister, help me is what he said to me and then sunk
Women skinning and then cutting them up in chunks
In comes, the woman with cocoa butter skin once

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, up a up in those kilts
Man you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, up a up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa Buffalo Bill

Eminem
Always, you can see him lurkin in the hallways
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawl space
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place
Hide them in the wall, well how long will the drywall take
Well fuck it then I got nothing but time, I'll wait
Until it dries for the moment I guess you're all safe
After I sand it and buff it I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin
You can even hear the evil spirits comin from within
Someone's in, the back of my damn house rummagin
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin
Vrrnn, on the hunt again; when, will it ever end
Evelyn, why you tryin to fight You will never win
Severin, legs, arms, damn there goes another limb
Pull the lever then, trap door, death is evident

Eminem
Now what you know about Buffalo Bill Nothin so chill
Fuckin hoe, you better fuckin hold still
Make sure none of that, lotion in the bucket don't spill
Cut 'em, gut 'em and just get to stuffin those girls
Man I think she had enough of those pills
Sedate her then I wait, I'll come back later just to clutch on those steel
blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin told you
I keep hearin voices, like wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
and push it right through her while you push ya shish kabob skewers
into her Barbecue her Would ya do to her
what you usually do to a girl whose skin's newer
torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya
Boo yah, who ya think you're fuckin with Duck because here he comes again

Yo, Dre man
Make my, vocals sound, sexy
Woo C'mon man, c'mon man, OKAY

It feels so wrong cause it feels so right
But it's all right, it's okay with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to, play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me
So I'm taking my ball and going home, hoooome

Eminem
I'm that guy man, shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut, poke holes in your shirt, jump in mud puddles
while I stomp mudholes in ya ass girl now let's cuddle
Blood curdling, you're gurgling on your blood, what'll
I do for my next trick I'm feeling won derful
I think I might just do somethin a little less subtle
Shove a fuckin Tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador 
of the Valentine's Day Massacre
Slash assassin, I'll slash her in the ass with a 
icicle and leave her lay in a bloodbath while I 
put a catheter in, and jump in the bath with her
In my Spider Man mask, man just imagine the
fun I can have with a strap on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachios Damn, I'd like to have some
Layin on the patio man, rolling a fat one
Shady drop the magic marker, put the cap on
Goddamn man, are you that much of an asshole

Eminem
I'm like Houdini, tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
one of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make the shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini
Believe me homie you don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter
I'm tryin to maneuver the Hoover up in your poop shoot, don't move or ya
might get it stuck so fuckin far up in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryin to do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular sniffing glue through a tube in the studia
Now who do ya think is more fruitier
Wiener smothered in peanut butter   putting on a tube of ya 
eye shadow and man it look nice, you shoulda seen it Mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my Visa card
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosey on over to Rosie O'Donnell's, with McDonald's
Jump in her lap then watch The Sopranos

Eminem
Shady what are ya doin chewin on a human
Grab an aluminum bat, hit Heidi Klum in the back, BOOM and
assumin the fact that that dude's in the back room
Usin the bathroom, vacuumin a raccoon
Skewin a rat, a cat screwin a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doing with that broom
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance I'm back doing my dance, ooh
But they're afraid I might get Sarah Palin 
by the hair and make her wear a bathing suit and take her parasailing
Shady, why do you gotta pick on the lady for
Why you make her read 84 bedtime stories to you in baby talk
Cause I'm scared, there's monsters under my bed
Kellie Pickler hid my juicebox under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti dyke Well I can pee pee and write your name

Fine, nobody wants to play with me
Fuck you then, bitch
Guys are always mean to me anyways
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gonna make me, make me sad
I'm gonna tell my mom, MOMMMMM

Yeah
Yeah girl
can you hear that
It's playing our song
are you sleepy
take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark are ya

you hear the beat
as it makes ya
not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door
it's locked so I go to creep
'round the back with binoculars
not 'cause I want to peep
but because I'm hungry
she smells like taco's
I want to eat
visions of hot choclatey marshmallows
also sweet
with sugar plums
oh look, here comes Marshall he's on your street
he's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
now walk on 'em
he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
like a Thanksgiving turkey
a holiday ham
see 'em sprinkled on toast
with strawberry marmalade jam
flavor my favorite graham crackers
with Jon Benet Rams
I guess a modern day jack the ripper
is all that I am
My music box

My music box
Cause when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep My music box
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me My music box
And when we're worlds apart, you mean the World to me My music box
If you call, I'll come, I will answer My music box
Cause when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep My music box
I hear my music box, playing a song for me My music box
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me My music box
Won't you be my private little dancer My music box

I almost look comatose
who wants to be sober gross
I foam like a doberman
mouth open I overdose
put coke up my nostrils
in both my holes then i plug my nose
my pupils quadruple in size
my eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's make up
get naked and run around
waving the gun around
I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
there's thunder, I wonder
how come it rains but the sun is out
the Devil's upset with his wife
they must be sluggin' it out
i must be buggin' the fuck out
what the fuck I'm 'bout
voices are leading me up to the attic
I love my house
they pull and they tug my blouse
the sound of a music box
comes from inside a toy chest
but what do I do it's locked
I pick it and open it
but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'till I find it, I wind it up
and the tune it starts
it's playing a song
so beautiful and the room is dark
the moon is full
I smell a funeral guess I'll loom in the park
my music box

when the lights are off
I see the girls asleep
but I'm waiting my love
keep calling me
we're worlds apart
but you mean the world to me

I'm fixated
on asphyxiating
and breakin' this little chick's neck
like a pixie stick
the sick, satan worshippin'
bitches get horse whippin'
I'm in the back
through the back
door slippin'
through the crack
leavin' the corpse drippin'
the mortician of love
sent from above
forced and treat 'em all
when she no more stingy I've become
been doing this for more than a quarter century
I'm just numb
am I dreamin' is it real
someone pinch me on the buns
the time has come
to tie her up
dada roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
climb up to the window look at her
the crime is slow to shatter
her brain matter and batter her
with a bat a matter of fact
that will splatter her
but before i do that
I'll have a chat to flatter her
give her two compliments back to back
like Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer
I'm back to ravish ya
so strong is your fight
but you're no match for Dracula
prolonging her plight
as I go back to stabbin' her
dismember her limbs
simple as that cadaver her
zoom in with the lens
then pan back the camera
stand back 'cause here comes your man Jack
so Pamela
my music box

Yeah boy
Dem better ring the alarm boy
Dem know what's comin boy
Buck, buck buck Ha ha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Eminem
Oh my God, fuckin bumbaclaat, I'm hard as Kenard
The little boy who shot Omar in The Wire
Tie a whore up with barbwire in nothin but a bra boy
I'm the real deal and charbroil her on the bonfire
And bon voyage bitch, I'm like Chef Boyar 
dee in this bitch, send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for ya boy, you think you're Tom Sawyer
'til I pull ya out the fuckin storybook and stomp on ya
Fuckin fictitional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourself for Captain America on ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact boy beware it's real
Them lyrics you wield equals zero to a hero's shield
Mister Fly by the Seat of His Pants parasail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearin zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no nada
Like your fa da fucking your ma da

Drop, the bomb on 'em   please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop, the bomb on 'em   I don't want no doggone beef
See Ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me

Eminem
Boy I'm the Real McCoy, you lil' boys can't even fill voids
Party's over kids, kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre the steel alloys, the rap crown royals
who scalp cowboys, now how that sound for ya
Yeah boy, you know we're 'bout to put it down for ya
So kick ya shoes off in the foyer, have a sound voyage
And sayonara, see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R and marinate in some marinara
And have a Coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar
of whip ass of ya, that's the last straw you're hopin to draw
Yeah you fresher than most, boy I'm just doper than all
Boy I'm that boy, boy dem boys, dem no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy I'm a star
Boy I told you boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm DeShaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the  Proof  boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy ya boy, fuck around and blow ya to sod
Oh my God, boy ya didn't go there, no you did not
I got a whole storyboard for ya, boy you're the plot
You're gettin got whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology, not accepted boy Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin ain't no tellin at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point at the spot, when the bomb drops
boy does it drop, and when it does boy there's a problem

Eminem
Boy don't jinx yourself, boy I'm Michael Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin hell boy, singin telegrams'll get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back better than ever, the cheddar shredder, the grater
The beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin haters incubators, think ya made a mistake
by sayin Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave, just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin place to Beirut in a day
So hey, wouldn't ya say I'm the shit Couldn't agree with ya more 
if you were to say that my fuckin shit doesn't stink
Shady fuckin Aftermath boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin water 'til we fill up the tank

Aiyyo, before I start this song man
I just wanna, thank everybody for bein so patient
And bearin with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out therrrre
It feels like I'm talkin to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from ohhhh
Can anybody hear meeee Yeah
I guess I keep talkin to myself
It feels like I'm goin insane
Am I the one who's crazy Yeah

Kobe
Whoooa, whoooa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoooa, whoooa, whoooa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

So why in the world, do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel
If there is then let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one

Eminem
I went away I guess and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was goin through, growin pains
Hatred was flowin through my veins, on the verge of goin insane
I almost made a song dissin Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him cause of the attention he was gettin
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin
and I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God it
feels like I'm goin psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin another pill, tryin to talk myself into it
Are you stupid You're gon' start dissin people for no reason
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even
You're lyin to yourself, you're slowly dyin, you're denyin your health
is declinin with your self esteem, you're cryin out for help

Eminem   Kobe
Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowin, self loathin and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though oh ohhhh whoa
But I must be talkin to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
I guess I keep talkin to myself
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
inside him; one foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin asleep with writer's block in the parking lot at McDonald's
But instead of feelin sorry for yourself do somethin 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted
long enough, it isn't them it's you you fuckin baby
Quit worryin 'bout what they do and do Shady, I'm fuckin goin crazy

Eminem
So I picked myself off the ground and fuckin swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
it's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushin 'em out
I've come to make it up to ya now, no more fuckin around
I got somethin to prove to fans cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
signs of slowin up, oh and I'm blowin up all over
My life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep ya head up
T.I. keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin 'em, rest in peace to DJ AM
Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um

So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or somethin
I guess I just, forgot who the fuck I was man
Aiyyo, and to anybody I thought about goin at
It was never nothin personal
Just some shit I was goin through
And to everybody else, I'M BACK I'm back
Ha ha

Yeah, haha
You know, critics man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say man
You know the one thing I notice about critics man
Is, critics never ask me how my day went
Well I'ma tell 'em

Ah, yesterday my dog died
I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blow up try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog, try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole 
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the 'dro
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Flow's tighter, hot headed his ghost writer
Cold hearted it's Spider Man throwin' a spider in the snow
So you better get, lower than Flo Rida 
Inside of a low rider with no tires in a hole 
Why am I like this Why is winter cold
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the ho's
Listen dog, Christmas is off
This is as soft as it gets, this isn't golf
This is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt
So get lost, shit dissin' me is just like pissin' off
The Wizard of Oz, wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it grab the scissors and saws and
Cut out your livers, gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like Sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tas ted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
Cause when you're hot it's like your burnin' up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man I'm so fucking sick I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll 
Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip hop shop to blow
You're on fire yeah
You're on fire

I just put a bullshit hook in between two
This ain't a song it's a warning to Brooke
Hogan and David Cook that the crook
Just took over so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writin' and kill it
I'm lighting in the skillet, you're a fucking a flash in the pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease 
Splashing the fan, Mr. Mathers is the man 
Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in the can
Come back and whoop your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulphuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand
A fucking chance is asinine, yeah ask Denaun man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him 
Color inside the lines or get hit with a flyin' crayon, 
Fuck it I ain't playin', pull up in a van 
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
Vietnam Vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind man
Kick over the can, beat his ass and leave him nine grand
So if I seem a little mean to you, this ain't savage you ain't never seen a brew
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poo
Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick
Don't nobody care, and why the FUCK am I yelling at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one cause ain't nobody there
And nobody'll fucking test me because these ho's wont even dare
I'm wasting punch lines, but I got so many to spare
I just thought up another one that might go here
Nah, don't waste it, save it psycho, yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair 

You're on fire
That's how you know you're on a roll
Cause when you're hot it's like your burnin' up, everyone else is cold
You're on fire
Man I'm so, I'm so hot my motherfucking fire truck's on fire homies
You're on fire
You need to stop, drop and roll 
Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip hop shop to blow
You're on fire Yeah
You're on fire Oh, shit
You're on fire

You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't, back, down
Oh no I won't, back, down
Oh no

Eminem
Cadillac Sevilles, Coupe DeVilles, brain dead rims, yeah stupid wheels
Girl I'm too for real, lose your tooth and nail

What I do I do at will, shootin from the hip, yeah boy shoot to kill
Half a breath left, on my death bed, screamin F that, yeah super ill
Baby what the deal We can chill, split a half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak slut, I'll cut my toes off and step on the receipt, 'fore I foot the bill
How you douche bags feel knowin you're disposable Summer's Eve, Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal, baby crank this shit cause it's your goddamn jam
You say that you want your punchlines a little more compact, well shorty I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said, Settle your fuckin ass down, I'm ready for combat man
Get it Calm Batman Nah, ain't nobody who's as bomb and as
nuts, lines are like mom's CAT scans cause they fuckin go ba na nas
Honey I applaud that ass, swear to God man these broads can't dance
Ma, show 'em how it's done, spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah

Eminem
Girl shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's, make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
playin with an Etch A Sketch, bet ya that you'll never guess who's knockin at your doors
People hit the floors, yeah tonight ladies you gon' get divorced
Girl forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads with Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue muh'fucker, you ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin licks like I'm robbin liquor stores, makin cash registers, shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin on your kitchen floor
Other words I'm off the meat rack, bring the beat back, bring me two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick, shit I need six inches more, fuck my dick's big
Bitch, need I remind you, that I don't need the fuckin swine flu, to be a sick pig
You're addicted, I'm dope, I'm the longest needle around here, need a fix ock
I'm the big shot, get it dick snots You're just small pokes, little pricks hah
Girl you think that other prick's hot I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
'fore I sit back and let him get hotter, better call the cops on him quick fast
Shady's right back on your bitch ass, white trash with a half a six pack
in his hatchback, trailer hitch a ttached to the back dispatch

Eminem
Bitch am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin Does a bird chirp
Does Lil Wayne slurp syrup 'til he burps and smoke purp Does a word search
get, circles wrapped around it like you do when I come through
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do 
when I'm on the mic, girl you're the kind of girl that I can take a likin to
Psych I'm spikin you, like a football, been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch, with a shitty spouse, got a pretty mouth, and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the woodgrain, don't want no cum stain, bitch you listening
Tryin to turn me down, slut I'm talkin to you, turn me back up Are you insane
Tryin to talk over me, in the car Shut the fuck up while my shit's playing
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the sayin Where there's thunder there's light 
ning and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place then
how the fuck have I been hit six times in three different locations on four separate occasions
And you can bet your stankin ass that I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path, poison ivy wouldn't have me thinkin rash
So hit the dance floor cutie while I do my duty on this microphone, shake your booty
Shorty I'm the shit, why you think Proof used to call me Doody

Yeah Ohh
Get up where my trash at
I said get up
You know what happens when I'm with trash man
Woo Let's go

Eminem
Better watch, out, now cause here we come come, come
And we ain't stoppin until we see the mornin sun sun, sun
So give us room to do our thing cause we ain't come to hurt, no, one one, one
So e'rybody come and get up on the floor now and grab, some, one one

Man first of all I'm a boss, I just wanna get that across
Man even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray painted doors
with the flames on 'em, Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin to put your claims on him
Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
we have of just gettin home, now can I get that lapdance
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
down and show this hussy who's the man, now get amped, dance

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nuttin but a white trash party white trash party
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks it ain't no one but us trash
You don't know ya better ask somebody
Cause we're havin a white trash party white trash party

Eminem
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care like a body without a head
Lookin like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead
And tomorrow I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I've been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixin Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like I'm hollerin Die Santa
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders yeah
So quit tryin to play the  Wall  like you're Paul and
get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap darling
Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly I start ballin
Makin it rain for the ladies in the mini's
But I'm not throwin ones, five, tens or even twenties
I'm throwin quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at Skinny's
Man I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the North, East and West but when it comes to them trailers in them  South Parks 
Muffle it, cause homie that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outtie
Now hop in my mini van, let's get rowdy, c'mon

Eminem
Now whether you're black, white or purple if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil and you're no damn good
Get on the flo' mayne and rep yo' hood
Now honey don't let them pricks trip, we should make a quick dip
and go do some donuts in the hospital parkin lot, cause girl I got a sick whip
Kick the back window out of my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
And, make a five seater, I'll be damned if I feed a 
chick, it ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita
I'll be the S L to the I M to the S H A D Y
and I don't need a tanktop to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'fore I turn over a new leaf clown, I'll tell you now
I'm so raw I still need to un thaw, you feel me y'all
I'll shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now git up

Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
Now some of you, might still be in that place
If you're tryin to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

I'm not afraid I'm not afraid
To take a stand to take a stand
Everybody everybody
Come take my hand come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road same road

Eminem
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin I do it, I don't give a damn
what you think, I'm doin this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me I'm tearin down your balcony
No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to that last Relapse album he's
still shittin, whether he's on salary, paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt

Eminem
Okay quit playin with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your fillings, instead of gettin crowned you're gettin capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehhh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin back to that now
All I'm tryin to say is get back, click clack, blaow
Cause I ain't playin around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin black cloud
still follows, me around   but it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin jumpin jacks now

Eminem
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this caaaaage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
for you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
my world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead, no more beef lingers
No more drama, from now on I promise 
to focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
and raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin at stars
I feel amazing and I'm not

Samples behind Eminem
Like a verbal seduction when
Seduction when I tell her...Girls on the shore
Girl, Girl, Girl...Right Now...Girls on the shore
Girl, Girl, Girl...Like a verbal seduction when...Girls on the shore
Girls on the shore...

Eminem
I don't know man, it just feels like...we're a lot different
I kinda feels like...I'm on a whole different page right now, than you
It feels strange but um...but I guess it's kinda like...it's kinda like

Eminem
I feel like I'm morphin'
Into something that's so incredible that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare
Endorphines I affect
Your self esteem shatters his dialect
Comes blastin out ya deck, she loves me
Such passion you'd expect
This sort of reaction, from her yet
You're stronger, you're fuck'n corny
You try to turn...your charm on
Cuz you just think you're 'bishop the Don Juan
But if you think you're fucking with me, homie you're on one
I'm cock'n my head back like Ed Lover, come on son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
You're boys are like, She's fuck'n with dude, she wants 'em
Oh boy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick cuz I spit better than you
What you expect her to do
How you expect her to act in the sack
When she's close'n her eyes
Fantasizing her diggn' her nails in my back to this track

Eminem   Samples
Seduction, Seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do  It's like a verbal seduction when...
Cuz one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you   It's like a verbal seduction when...
Seduction, SeduceSeduction when I got girls on the shore...
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cuz one minute she loves you, the next she don't I got girls on the shore...
She's been stolen from you   It's like a verbal seduction when...

Eminem
She's sitting there gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a 7 disc CD changer in the car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not Aw
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet a star
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhym'n one syllable Naw
Switch it up, and watch them haters not give it up
Cuz they just not good enough, but I'm not givin up
Til I get my respect, and I won't stop til I get enough
Cuz I'm not livin up to my own expectations Aw
That hater alarm is sound'n, ah, but Obama took the bomb from my name Oa
So quit crying that I took your dame homie, she my dame aw
You're sadly mistaken if you think'n that I'm not on my game boy
And thangs, just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you holler'n my name for
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man I can't call it

Eminem
It's like we're playin'n lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl come here, put your ear up to the speaker
Dear, while I freak this...world premier
Seducin' her, loosen' up with a little freestyle, what wa wait am I'm lose'n ya
Am I makin you look bad 
Well I got news for your homie you're lose'n her
Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast, I'ma try to show ya how
Let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blowout, you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something
To see if you can save any of it, bu but none of it's fuck'n with me
Prick you really feel'n that bullshit, you think you kill'n them syllables
Quit play'n, these beats ain't nothing to fool with 
They call me Fire Marshall, I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round Woo
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome, and you are just awe struck
She's love stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From suck'n my dick, aw fuck

Love, love...
Love, love, love...
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more, no more
Love, love..

Lil Wayne
Young Money, yeah, uhh
Throw dirt on me, and grow a wildflower
But it's fuck the world, get a child out her
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothin 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rollin sweets, I'm smokin sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars, are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands, are full of open bibles
Uhh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin not to sweat
And these niggaz know I'll lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin to the script, you niggaz skippin scenes
Uhh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin right I got my gun, semi Cartermatic
Yeah, put the dick in they mouth so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in a cage Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in a safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my do' but I don't even check the peep hole
So you could keep knockin, but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

It's a little too late, to say that you're sorry now
You showed me nothin but hate, you ran me into the ground

No loooove no no loooove no no loooove no no loooove
LW Hah, bitch you get no
Em You get no
No loooove no no loooove no no love

Eminem
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life, I can
see these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than, most, shit's finna get thick again
They say the, competition is stiff but I get a hard dick from this shit now stick it in
I ain't never givin in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em
They call me a freak cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these wack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap was tight but I'm
scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference 
when I rip the stage and tear it in half tonight, it's an
adrenaline rush you feel the bass thump from the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold hearted, from the day I Bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow
When I'm not even at my harshest, you can still get roasted cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin from the top I'm not gonna stop, I'm standin on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore 
And you could never break my stride, you'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin the flow, slow venom any opponent
is gettin no, mercy mark my words, ain't lettin up, relentless I smell blood
I don't give a fuck Keep givin 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up
You get no love

No loooove no no loooove no no loooove no no loooove
LW Hah, bitch you get no
Em You get no
No loooove no no loooove no no love
LW Hah, bitch you get no

Eminem
We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us, it's lust
It's torturous, you must, be a sorceress cause you just
did the impossible, gained my trust, don't play games it'll be dangerous
if you fuck me over, cause if I get burnt I'ma show ya
what it's like to hurt, cause I been treated like dirt, befo' ya
And love is evol, spell it backwards I'll show ya
Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion what so ever so
Don't ask me why I have no, love for these muh'fuckin hoes
Blood suckin succubuses, what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department but, I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin to start over
I got a hole in my heart but some kind of emotional roller coaster's
somethin I won't go on so you toy with my emotions, hoe it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't jokin when I told you
You take my breath away, you're a supernova
And I'm a

I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin right at youuuu, right at youuuu
250 thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin right at youuuu, right at youuuu, right at youuuuuuu

Eminem
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't, with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take Let's cut to the chase
'fore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break
and leave myself open that I won't be makin a mistake
Cause I'm a

Eminem
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin, I'm tryin to stop you from leavin
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin to stop you from breathin
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin
'til I snap your neck like a popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give

And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our, love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star cause I'm a

I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin right at youuuu, right at youuuu
250 thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without youuuu, without youuuu, without youuuuuuu

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase 25 to life
Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing em
Taking my life like that
Caught in a chase
25 to life

I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
I'ma take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'ma be the boss of you now goddamnit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you, why I've stayed
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I won't be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
Did me a favour though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but it's

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase 25 to life

I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Till I snap
Don't think I'm loyal All I do is rap
I can not moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time
You don't think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat em like you don't need em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you oh,
Now I'm special, I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chewed me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
It's ridiculous
And still I stick with this
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
You're addictive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em
My friends keep asking me why I cant just walk away from
I'm addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drawn in, shit I guess I'm a mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time I
Aint changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that ill be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you hip hop
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And its just

Yeah...
Haha..you feel that baby
Yeah, I feel it too..
Damn..
You know..I'm so glad we could spend this time together
See, not as crazy as you thought I was am I
Heh...

I'm the American dream I'm the definition of white trash balling
I'm right back on 'em, with the
Same shit, different toilet, oh you got a nice ass darlin'
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we aint fuckin', you take me for a friend
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama
I'm a rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Trauma
Keep my entourage with me, baby i'll make a promise
There aint nobody as bomb as, me I'm as calm as
The breeze, I'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms I'm a
S superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pyjamas

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you aint never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo, first I kiss your navel
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find something more stable
I told you I aint fooling from the gate, this aint the first day of april
But thank you for staying April, I'ma make you learn
To appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phoney, little fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggy bear and all the kissyface, please
Initiate phase three Missy now service me
Take another shot of Jager, shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady
I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did you
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you
Got a twisted sense of humour, it's warped, but I didn't hit you
I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm...

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you aint never met nobody like me
And you aint gonna want no fucking body else again

Bridge
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go...
'cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh..

I got you caught up in the rapture
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped you
You never wanted someone so bad you're sweating
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed you
Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic
You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and
Throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
So stop with the snoring, pick your pint up
Let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one'll knock cause I'ma hang a sign up
Saying Don't Disturb, shorty I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you aint never met nobody like me
And you aint gonna want no fucking body else again

Bridge
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go...
'cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh..

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I Guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you aint never met nobody like me
And you aint gonna want no fucking body else again

Haha...
Dr. Dre
2010
Light years ahead of you..haha...
Whoo

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie..

Eminem
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
me, she fuckin hates me, and I love it, wait
Where you goin I'm leavin you No you ain't
Come back, we're runnin right back, here we go a gain
It's so insane, cause when it's goin good it's goin great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, who's that dude I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Eminem
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're wit 'em
You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin, yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin fuckin sick of lookin at 'em
You swore you'd never hit 'em   never do nothin to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya
both, so they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again; now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane/pain

Eminem
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby please
come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist, at the drywall
Next time, there won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies, I'm tired
of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin leave again, I'ma tie her
to the bed and set this house on fire
I'm just gonna

The days are cold, livin without youuuuu without youuuuu
The nights are long, I'm growin olderrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I miss the days of old, thinkin about youuuuu thinkin about youuuuu
You may be gone, but you're never overrrrrrrrrrr

Eminem
If Proof, could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's somethin in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try it'll be them doors, on Dre's Phantom, believe me clowns
That means suicide homie you'll never throw me, off of this course, blow me
Bitch I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talkin awards homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely on top of the world when you're the only
one with the balls in your shorts to leave their jaws on the floors with no re 
morse, 'member that when they get to doggin your boy homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin about bolog na
I'm not gonna stop the saga continues, no stoppin the force Obi
I'm moppin the floors with 'em, I keep tryin to pass it but they keep 
on droppin the torch and it won't be, long 'til the sport is O V 
E R, Just Blaze and me we are knockin them doors and no we
ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch so be
careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S N double O P, let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't travellin down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me

And it don't stop, ohhh
And it don't quit, ohhh
And it don't stop, ohhh
And it don't quit, ohhh
And I miss youuuu, ohhh
I just miss youuu, ohhh
I just miss youuu, ohhh
And homie I'll never forget you, noooo

Eminem
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC, wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I can do right now Doody for you is to rep
So I'm gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
Cause the way that I'm feelin to night, everything I can just do right
There's nothin that I could do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and bust it   excuse the corny metaphor
but they'll never  ketchup , to all this energy that I've  mustard 
So God just, help me out while I fight through this grievin process
Tryin to process this loss is makin me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin me hostage, I've been patiently watchin
this game pacin these hallways; you had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em holmes
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie I know I'm, never gonna be the same without you
I never would've came in this game, I'm goin insane without you
Matter fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me Naw Doody you're not, layin on that table I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said Think of Hailie I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doody

Aww man, yeah
You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
People that you don't even know jump in

Eminem
You feel like you wanna hit somethin, your fist clenches, you're pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
from splittin your shit wide open, no stitches can save
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
you end up goin out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
Razors scissors and blades make Jason say Isn't this great
On lookers participate in this ass kickin debate
that's startin to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all out brawl soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene but it's too late
It's absolute pandemonium, whisked away
in an ambulance is your fate
Nothin nobody told you when you left the house today coulda made you anticipate
such an ass whippin, okay, 'til the anger dissipates
You get punched in the face, reciprocate; c'mon

So what the deal ridaz
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts
My balls are feelin a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my brit ches
I said, so what the deal ridaz
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts
My balls are feelin a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my brit ches

Eminem
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mase cause Shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fuckin lighter you feel, now you still wanna grill
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
Cause if you doubt me you will, yeah got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill
Girl howdy, how do you feel ma
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh hell naw
He must be tryin to kill my buzz
I will not budge, so what the deal ridaz
Now here they all come and they got your back in like two seconds flat
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expectin that
bottle, we snuck it in cause the beer that they was servin here was only tap
I'm bitin, I fight dirty
You might get kicked in the nuts, you're frightened like This guy might hurt me
You're quite certained he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
dig your way out or go powder your nose
Pussy the louder you yell the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off faggot so now how do you 'spose
we settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes

Eminem
It's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tusslin, the crowd's startin to cheer us and
adrenaline's rushin through us just like a geyser gushin
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm stranglin your windpipe for nothin
My signature's ligature marks
Look at you all big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
and dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick as Bizarre
Shit this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
as havin me wanna rip out your frickin ligaments, AHHH
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails
For that, you catch an open hand slap like a female
Like BAP In fact I'll have the crowd smackin you themselves
Where's D12 I don't feel like doin this by myself; c'mon

Yeah, what the deal
I'm feelin hard as hell right now homie
Almost feel, invincible and shit
Ay Dre, you got me feelin like
I can't be touched right now fool, ha ha
I'm unstoppable, damn

Eminem
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noooooise
Ohh shit, yeah
Y'all ready to get this shit started or what
Aight, well I brought some friends with me too

Now I ain't back just for the sake of just sayin I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniel's and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin   whoa oh
I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin, uh oh
You can call me R. Kelly now, urine/you're in, trouble
What's occurrin befo', after and durin the show
has no bearing on the bad news I'm baring, whoa
What is it, wordplay No I'm pushin you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fuckin feet 'til you get to squishin a hoe
It's pandemo nium, standin O when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're givin me wood
You should, pull over like a sweat shirt with a hood
Let's network, get our polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm coppin over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass
Who claims to be spittin the same flames as me I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident and bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half
So stop fakin the funk and start shakin your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
and Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazin than that
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at

Royce Da 5'9
I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers'll pry apart you
Lump on yo' head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy I.'ll fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the linin
I pull it out and flip your partner upside down like y'all are a couple 69'in
It's like Rick James is shootin up your house nigga
You're screamin Fuck the world with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shovin my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch, know I'm perfectly fit, for murder
because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neuman,  Mad  cerebral
You on your last burrito
What that mean Nickel It's a wrap if you eatin
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on FIRE, nobody touchin that
Good day and good night, Ortiz yo where the FUCK you at

Joell Ortiz
I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light years 
ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a  Nightmare 
Where my book at I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art, of you nice wear
It's type weird cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishin off his ninth beer
Homie chill, listen, I swear
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be
Just waitin to be hooked to IV as Mumm Ra's well when you look at my pee
And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink when I rip his intestines
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit
seems to be non contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Emiddinem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgustin hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook

Crooked I
I'm right here lettin the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winnin
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla   they wanna drop my britches
then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flyin
We do it to try to do without tryin
Slaughterhouse Cause to it's us it's so easy
Where's, Jumpoff Joe Beezy

Don't kill me
Let me see your hands, bend over

Yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah

Eminem
My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle then crashed in
the side of a locomotive with rap, I'm
loco, it's like handin a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm
Your music usually has 'em
But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan
A Jedi in trainin
Colossal brain and, thoughts of entertainin
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a Picasso paintin
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage, I need a seein eye dog
Can't even find the page I was writin this rhyme on
Oh, it's on the ram page, couldn't see what I wrote, I write small
It says Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with white walls, had a fire in my heart
and a dire desire to aspire to DIE HARD
So as long as I'm on the clock punchin this time card
hip hop ain't dyin on my watch

Now sometimes, when I'm sleepin, she comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken Is she taken Is she mine Is she mine
Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to, promise land, and threaten everyone haha
Cause there's no rhyme, or no reason, for no thing

Eminem
NO If he had
He wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad
Yeah, dad~
I'm, the epitome and the prime example
of what happens when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and
makes you wanna get up and start dancin
even if it is Charles Manson
who just happens to be rappin, blue lights flashin
Laughin all the way to the bank, lamping in my K Mart mansion
I'm in the style department
with a pile in my cart, rippin the aisle apart but
With great power comes absolutely no responsiblity for content
Completely despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
beat killin spree, Your Honor, I must
plead guilty, cause I sparked the
revolution, rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
Hip hop is the devil's music
Does that mean, it belongs to me
cause I just happen to be
a white honkey devil with two horns that don't honk
but every time I speak, you hear a beep
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me bitch, cause it's the

It's the time time of the season of the season when hate runs high high
And this time, won't give it to you easy when I take 
when I take back what's mine, with pleasured hands
And torture everyone; that is my plan haha my job here isn't done haha
Cause there's no rhyme, or no reason, for no thing

Eminem
So yeah dad, let's WALK
Let's have us a father and son TALK
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one BLOCK
without me knockin your block OFF, this is all your FAULT
Maybe that's why
I'm so bananas, I ap peeled to all those walks of life
whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
Cause I, related to the struggles
of young America when their fuckin parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're rippin out their fuckin hair again, it's hyster ical
I chuckle, as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckle 
heads, the sign on my hustle
says don't knock, the door's broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite, zip your lip
If you dish it but can't take it, too busy gettin
stoned in your glass house
to kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mr. Mathers as advertised on the flyers
so spread the word cause I'm promotin my passion 'til I'm passed out
Completely brain dead, Rain Man
doin the Bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier
than all eight other reindeer
put together with Chief Keef cause I hate every fuckin thing, yeah
Even this rhyme bitch
And quit tryin to look for a fuckin reason for it that ain't there
And I still am a CRIMINAL
10 year old degenerate grabbin on my GENITALS
The last Mathers LP done went diamond
This time I'm predictin that this one'll go EMERALD
Ha, when will the madness end
How can it when there's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to send
is dad, I'm back at it again

Eminem Yeah~

This, is, survival of the fittest
This, is, do or DIIIIIE
This, is, the winner takes it all
So take it all oh ohh oh ohh ohhhhhh

Eminem
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill prepared
I was prepared to be ILL though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout bustin raps and standin for somethin, fuckin acronym
Cut the fuckin act like you're happy I'm fuckin back again
with another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of what'll
happen to them wolves, when the thought of bein thrown 
into an alligator pit I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah egos I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium ERUPT   cause

Eminem
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish, I'm so close
to my goals I can almost pole vault, over the goal post post
And if I don't got enough in the tank maybe I can just siphon enough
to fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what
They said I was washed up and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucker and if I don't make the cut, what, like I give a fuck
I'ma light this bitch up like I'm drivin a truck
through the side of a pump
Zero to sixty, hop in and  gun it  like G Unit without the hyphen, I'm hypin 'em UP
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a RUT
And I look like I might just give up, ehh, might've mistook
me for bowin out, I ain't takin a bow
I'm stabbin myself with a fuckin knife in the gut, while I'm wipin my BUTT
Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin CUT
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a NUT
Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin the dust
It'll just, make me angrier, wait, let me remind you of what
got me this far, picture me quittin
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
It's survival of WHAT

Liz Rodrigues
So take it all oh ohh oh ohh ohhhhhh

Eminem
Yeah So get your ideas uhh stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
I don't do this music shit I'll lose my SHIT
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in the booth, I SPIT
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin you the flow no one do
Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I QUIT
So there's nothin for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you'd better trade your fuckin mics in for some tool box es
Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So pull out your pliers and your screw dri vers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh lieve
Cause this is somethin that I must use to suc ceed
And if you don't like me then FUCK you, self esteem
must be fuckin shootin through the roof, cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
a llergic to failure cause every time I come close to it I just sneeze
But I just go ah choo, then A CHIEVE

Liz Rodrigues
So take it all oh ohh oh ohh ohhhhhh

Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you for you, for you

Eminem
I used to be the type of kid that, would always think the sky is fallin
Why am I so differently wired Am I a Martian
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Cause I don't belong in this world, that's why I'm scoffin
at authority, defyin often, flyin off at
the handle at my mom, no dad, so I am non com 
pliant at home, at school, I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
tryin to diagnose why, I have all these underlyin problems
thinkin he can try and solve 'em, I'm outside chalkin
up drawings on the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin
to myself, either that or inside hidin off in
the corner somewhere quiet, tryin not to
be noticed cause I'm cryin and sobbin
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin locker cause he said that I eyeballed him

Polina
And if you fall, I'll catch you there
I'll be your savior from
all the wars that are fought, inside your world
Please have faith in my words...
Cause

This is my legacy legacy, ehhhhhh
This is my legacy legacy, ehhhhhh
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
That this is my legacy legacy, legacy legacy

Eminem
I used to be the type of kid that, would always think the sky is fallin
Why am I so differently wired, in my noggin
Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind bogglin
Cause I obsess on everything, in my mind small shit
bothers me but not my father, he said Sayonara
then split, but I don't give a shit, I'm fine long as
there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothin's the matter with me, shit look on the bright side, least I ain't walkin
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a ten speed, which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame, then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me, life offers
Why bother even tryin to put up a fight It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin They're kinda givin me confidence
Instead of tryin to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little somethin like Onyx
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
say what I wanna say to that kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like That's right, fight's on bitch
Who woulda knew from the moment I turned the mic on that
I could be iconic, in my conquest
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

Eminem
I used to be the type of kid that, would always think the sky is fallin
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work words like this
and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength, to try and draw from
and get inspired off 'em
Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
by you wack fuckin giant sacks of lyin dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talkin
Thought I was full of horse shit and now you fuckin worship the ground on which I am walkin
Me against the world, so what I'm Brian Dawkins
versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions' offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch, I'm supplyin coffins
Cause you  Dicks Butt kiss , a bunch of Brian Balding 
ers, you're gon' die a ball licker, I've been diabolic 
al with this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass in a flyin saucer
full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
'til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me, is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall
And this is my

Eminem
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role think I succeeded fulfillin
But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speakin to children
Everything was happenin so fast it was like I blinked, sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin ridiculous cause I was gettin sick of this feelin
Like I'm always under attack, man I coulda stacked my shit list to the ceiling
Women dishin but really
thinkin if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin shit, but since when did this many
people ever give a shit what I had to say It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mention a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform, I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect, and battled for it
Mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed, atta boy
They told me to slow down, I'd just zone out
Good luck tryin to convince a blonde, it's like tellin Gwen Stefani she sold out
Cause I was tryin to leave,  No Doubt 
in anyone's mind one day I'd go down, in history think they know now
Because EVERYBODY knows

Everybody knows, that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide, you are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Eminem
Thanks for the support asshole

Quit actin salty, I was countin on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he roundabout dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, well goddamn honkey; that compliment's like back handin a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him, but what the fuck's all this trash talking about
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me, you knocked me down
I went down for the count, I fell but the fans caught me and now
you're gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me to take my belt, word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothin else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out, or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quotin
Shake speare, so what if insults are revoltin
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet riddled, but you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess, gotta have a goddamn
vest on your chest and a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test the testicles Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage, rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those
water bottles in Colorado, so get lost Waldo
My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
A black hole and I'm swallowin this track whole, better pack toilet paper
But I'm takin no crap hoe, here I go down the Bat Pole
and I'm changing back into that ol' maniac, in fact there they go
Tryin to dip out the back door retreating cause EVERYBODY knows

Eminem
Holy mackerel, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth, I smacked a girl
off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
for thinkin we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed, ICP in this bitch How do fuckin magnets work
Cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable, hate to be dramatical
but I'm not romantical, I'm makin up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin a joke It's laughable
Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault, so it's safe to say, I'm un crackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch you just need a helmet, cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one track mind and
shorty you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49er
Cause you've been a gold digger since you was a miner/minor
Been tryin to, hunt me down like a dog cause you're on my ass but you can't get a scent
Cause all of my spare time's spent
on my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin
Only women that I love are my daughters, but sometimes I rhyme
and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent, I'll never grow up
So to hell with your parents, and  mother fuck  Father  Time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who  Transformed  to an  Optimist  in his  Prime 
So even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half empty glass in a cup, now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a motherfuckin coaster
I'm goin back to what got me here
Yeah cocky and can't knock bein Rudolph, so fear not my dear/deer
And dry up your tear drops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
if you stare at me and see yourself, cause you're one too, shouldn't be a shock
because EVERYBODY knows everybody knows

Eminem
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes' on the ra aaag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to   kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to   crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to   picket
But quick to get impaled, when I tell 'em   stick it
So sick I'm lookin pale, oh that's my   pig ment
'Bout to go HAM, ya bish, shout out to   Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim   BITCH
The art of emceein mixed with Da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend   BITCH
Been  Public Enemy  since you thought P.E. was gym   BITCH

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
Grow your beard out, just weird out

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down so turn the volume loud
Cause it's, mayhem 'til the A.M.
Let yourself gooo ohh ohh
Say fuck it, before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke

Eminem
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced, so I guess it ain't
that aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, checkmate
But girl your body's bangin, jump me in, dang, bang bang
Yessiree Bob, I was thinkin the same thang
So come get on this  Kid's Rock ,  Bawitdaba , dang dang
Pow p p p pow, chka pow chicka wow wow
Got ya gal blowin up a val v v val valve
Ain't slowin down, throw in the towel, t t towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh huh, how how
Least I know that I don't know, question is are you bozos
smart enough to feel stupid Hope so
Now hoe

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down so turn the volume loud
Cause it's, mayhem 'til the A.M.
Let yourself gooo ohh ohh
Say fuck it, before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke

Eminem
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep, and woke up in that Monte Carlo
with the ugly Kardashian, Lamar oh
Sorry yo we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though
that's the past but I done did enough Codeine to knock  Future  into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin to find a way to get you a loan, CAR NOTE
OHH~ Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangols and Car heart less cargoes
Girl you're fixin to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd ma'am; you bird brain baby
I ain't called anybody Baby since Birdman   unless you're a swallow haha
Word Rick Word man, you heard; but don't be discouraged girl
This is YOUR JAM, unless you got TOE JAM

Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings, but..
I'm only going to get this one chance.
Something's wrong, I can feel it.
It's just, a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what.
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble.
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.
You were just what the doc ordered

Six minutes, six minutes, chka, six minutes
Six minutes Slim Shady you're on
Chka chk, chk chk on, chka chk chk on
Six minutes, for six
For six minutes Slim Shady you're on
Chka chk, on, chka chk, on, chka chk chk

I'm beginnin to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

Eminem
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes/jeans, I got a laptop in my back pocket

My pen'll go off when I half cock it, got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin and a killin off it, ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
with Monica Lewinsky feelin on his nut sack, I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell, syllables, skill a holic   kill 'em all with
this flippity dippity hippity hip hop, you don't really wanna get into a pissin match with this rappidy rap
Packin a Mac in the back of the Ac', backpack rap crap, yap yap yackety yack
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts, while I'm practicin that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin table over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow All I do is drop F bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad, for the wack while I'm masterfully constructin this masterpiece yeah
Cause

Eminem
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
Let me show you maintainin this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got

Well to be truthful the blueprint's, simply rage and youthful excuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid and did nothin but shoot for the moon since pyoon
MC's get taken to school with this music cause I use it
as a vehichle to  Bus the Rhyme , now I  Lead a New School  full of students
Me I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N. 
W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
to meet Run D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin Rock 'N
Roll Hall of Fame, even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alco hol of fame on the wall of   shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I  Walk a Flock of Flames 
off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin
Little gay lookin boy, so gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy haha
You're witnessin a massacre/mass occur like you're watchin a church gatherin take place lookin boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say lookin boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back and a way to go from your label every day lookin boy
Hey lookin boy, what ya say lookin boy I get a hell yeah from Dre lookin boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit, get out my face lookin boy
Basically boy, you're never gonna be capable of keepin up with the same pace lookin boy
Cause

Eminem
The way I'm racin around the track call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the white trash God
Kneel before General Zod, this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omni potent
Let off then I'm reloadin immediately with these bombs I'm totin
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin dead but I'm just a talkin head, a zombie floatin, but I got your mom deep throatin
I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothin in common poodle
I'm a Doberman,  Pinsch'  yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
for good at least once in a while
so I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
enough rhymes to, maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case, cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry lookin at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
was king of the underground but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes, when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine, you get too big and here they come tryin
to censor you like that one line I said on I'm Back from the Mathers LP 1 when I
tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK 47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
morphin into an immortal comin through the portal
You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for, you're
pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin, cornrows
You write normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad singin to a man while he played piano
Man oh man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day, Hey Fab
I'ma kill you Lyrics comin at you at  Supersonic  speed   J. J. Fad
Uhh, samma lamma dooma lamma, you assumin I'm a human, what I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin audience a feelin like it's levitating
Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated, I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream Well that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
with rock, shock rap with Doc, throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that, I don't know what words to use
prove that if you were half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too
Unhh~ School flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me, full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to and I'm a, million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so Satan take the fuckin wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumpin Heavy D and the Boys, still  Chunky But Funky 
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and, here's what they want from me
They're askin me to eliminate some of the women hate, but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women, how the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then
Don't mistake him for Satan
to trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
don't be a retard   be a king Think not
Why be a King, when you can be a God

Or Eminem has a full line of chainsaws
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Em in em
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper Eminem

Who can say for sure
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer.
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
society would reap a great benefit.

Eminem
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer Case of Tourette's
Fuck, fuck fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbor's hedges
Like This is how I'll cut your face up bitches with these hedge trimmin scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess
and make the best of this situation, I guess
Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
despicable, I'm sick of just gettin pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a freakin wuss, a pussy, this kid just took
my stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was 6 and shook
This fucker was 12 and was six foot with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's usin your head   momma always said

Momma always said, If you had a brain you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong, momma I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb, I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said, Son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless

Eminem
Fast forward some years later, a teenager, this is a fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat
I've accomplished, they've stomped me into the mud, gee for what reason You stumped me
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, beat down and be upbeat
when you don't have no thing
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
Cause you're doomed from the start, it's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicin trash
talkin in a trance, locked in my room yeah, but I got some plans momma
These damn rhymes are fallin out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it
And I'm startin to blend in more, in school this shit helps for sure
I'm gettin more self assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore
I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch, end of story
Still in my skull's a vacant empty void, been usin it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory, in this gourd
there's a Ford engine, door hinge, syringe, an orange, an extension cord, and a ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
Ironin board, a bench, a wrench, a ore, winch, an attention whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin chain, like an independent store
Something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
cause I'd probably be Dahmer   cause momma always said

Eminem
Now my mom, goes wamp wamp wamp
Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on the bottom of the pile gettin stomped
But somehow, I came out on top ohh ooh ohh

I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice y'all, fuck it I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go they scream out Go I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Out sold the sell outs, freak the hell out, Middle America hear 'em yell out
in terror they were so scared
And those kids, just about, belted out, whatever spouted or fell out
my smart aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
motherfuckin, difficult yeah, 'til then hopefully ya
little homos get over your fears and phobias
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoked queers
'til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
a stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors, tactical practical jokes yeah
You motherfuckin Insert insult here
Who the fuck would've thunk that one little ol' MC'd
be able to take the whole culture and re upholstery it
And boy they did flock, can't believe this little hick locked
this hip hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got
that white trash traffic in gridlock, shit hoppin like six blocks
from a Kid Rock/Insane Clown Posse concert in mid Oc 
tober, and God forbid I 
see the Wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium y'all cause
I'll turn into the Unabomber   momma always said

Insaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck
Neither is ain't

Eminem   singing
You used to say, that I'd, never be
nothin without you, and I, believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby hold, me please
And I'd beg, and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry, and I'd scream, Baby please don't leave
Snatch the keys, from your hand, I would squeeze
and you'd laugh, and you'd tease, you're just fuckin with me
And you must hate me; why do you date me
if you say I make you siiiiick
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the eeeeedge

But you won't break me, you'll just make me, stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just   FINE without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up, and UHHH
But I'ma still be humble, when I scream fuck you cause I'm stronger than I waaaaas

Eminem   singing
A beautiful face, is all, that you have
Cause on the inside you're, ug ly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby hold, me please
And I'd beg, and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry, and I'd scream, Baby please don't leave
But you left, and you took, everything
I had left, and left nothin, nothin for me
So please don't wake me, from this dream baby
We're still together in my heeeeead
And you're still in love with me
'til I woke up to discover that that dream was deeeeead

Eminem   rapping
You walked out... I almost died
It was almost a homicide that you caused cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride, I'd rather die than you not by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried, go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde, nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde, I felt like my
whole relationship with you was a lie, it was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die
Cause if you coulda, took my life you woulda, it's like you put a
knife through my chest and pushed it right through to the, other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
put up more of a fight but I couldn't at the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that Bite me bitch, chew on a nineteen footer
Cause this morning I finally stood up, held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
first time since you left and left me with nothin but shattered dreams and the life we coulda
had and what coulda been, but I'm breakin out of this slump I'm in
Pullin myself out of the dumps once again, I'm gettin up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'ma be late for the pity party, but you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ, so don't lump me in with them chump ions
I'm done being your punchin bag, it was November 31st today
Would've been our anniversary, two years but you left on the first of May
I wrote it on a calender, was gonna call but couldn't think of the words to say

singing
And I thank you uhh cause you made me uhh a better person than I was
But I hate you uhh cause you drained me uhh I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me uhh you're crazy uhh and after all that's said and done
I'm still angry, yeah I may be, I may never trust someooooone

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin to save me, stop holdin your breath
And you think I'm crazy; yeah you think I'm crazy

Eminem
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosy
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
for wantin my cake and eat it too, and wantin it both ways
Fame made me a balloon, cause my ego inflated when I blew, see
But it was confusing, cause all I wanted to do's be
the Bruce Lee, of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
WOO Hit the lottery, ooh wee
But with what I gave up to get, it was bittersweet
It was like winnin a used mink
Ironic cause I think I'm gettin so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin to lose sleep   one sheep, two sheep
Goin cuckoo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Cause I'm

Well that's nothin
Oh ohhh oh ohhh, oh ohhh oh ohhh
Oh ohhh oh ohhh, ohhh ohhh ohhhh
Well that's nothin
Oh ohhh oh ohhh, oh ohhh oh ohhh
Oh ohhh oh ohhh, oh ohhh oh ohhh

Eminem
Now I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it could all be over tomorrow so I keep conjurin
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin your mind the way it wanders
Yodelodaley hee hoo I think it went wanderin
off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself, and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killin me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin me in the head, keep knockin
Nobody's home, I'm sleep walkin
I'm just relayin what the voice in my head's sayin, don't shoot the messenger
I'm just friends with the

Eminem
Call me crazy but I have this vision
one day that, I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm 
comin straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and I'll
take you back to the days that, I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that, pumped up feelin
and shit to say back, to the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fuckin children
But if one kid, out of a hundred million
who are goin through a struggle feels it and relates, that's
great It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin way back
in the draft, turn nothin into somethin, still can make that
straw into gold chump I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straitjacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin, I'm still friends with the

I own a mansion, but live in a house
A king size bed but, I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Bright Side, glass is half full
But my tank's half empty, gasket just blew

Eminem
This always happens, thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin
Only option I have's McDonalds' bathroom
In a public stall droppin a football
so every time someone walks, in the  John  I get  Maddened 
Shady, what up What C'mon man, I'm crappin
and you're askin for my goddamn autograph on a napkin
Oh that's odd, I just happened
to run out of tissue, yeah hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then
Thanks dawg, name's Todd, a big fan
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad, threw it back and
Told him Todd, you're the shit, when's all of this crap end
Can't pump my gas without causin an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fuckin trash
without someone passin through my sub harassin
I'd count my blessings but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask, sufferin succotash
But the antacid, it gives my stomach gas
when I mix my corn with my fuckin mashed
potatoes, so what hoe, kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upper class
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in the cupboard, plasticware up the ass
Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that
B boy to the core, mule I'm as stubborn as

Maybe that's why it feels so strange
Got it all but I still won't change
Maybe that's why, I can't leave De TROIT
It's the motivation that keeps me GOING
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me

Eminem
They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I'd doin if it weren't rap, probably be a giant turd sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned 40 and still sag, teenagers act more fuckin mature jack
Fuck you gonna say to me I'll leave on my own terms ass 
hole, I'm goin  Berzerk , my nerves are bad
but I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her, dag
Her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged
You're Danica Patrick yeah word skag
We'd be the perfect match, cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck's all of these buttons 
You expect me to sit here and learn that
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda Be an expert at
computers I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica, hell with
Playstation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo bitch, run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the
mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread, make a sandwich with Welch's
and belch, they say this spray butter's bad for my health but
I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford and welfare, mentality helps to
keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
managed to dwell, within these parameters
Still crammin the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt, a
creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
with all these pet peeves, goddamn it to hell I
can't stand all these kids, with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell, the
other day, someone got all elaborate
and stuck a head from a fuckin dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma's catchin up with me

Got friends on Facebook, all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So I'm Artist of the Decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up but, the frame is all cracked

Eminem
I'm tryin to be low key, hopefully nobody notices me
in produce, hunched over, giant nose bleed
Ogre, style as I, mosey
over to the frozen aisle, by the frozen, yogurt, this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica, with Hova
The show's over, I'm hidin in Kroger, buyin groceries
He just had front row seats, told me, sign this poster then insults me
WOW, up close didn't know you had crow's feet
I'm at a crossroads, lost, still shoppin at Costco
Sloppy joes, bulk waffles
Got caught pickin my nose, ahh~ Look over see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em, stuck at the light, the fuckin shit's
takin forever to change, it's stuck, these bitches are lovin it
Rubbin it in, chucklin   couldn't do nothin
Play it off, What you bumpin 'Trunk Muzik', Yelawolf's better Fuckin bitch
They want me to flip at the label but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with a 
nother one after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin recovery, if I fumble it
Cause I'ma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hoppin out shrubbery on you sons of bitches   wrong subdivison
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin out
Kool Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
But bitch I got an  Elevator  in my house, ants and a mouse
I'm livin the DREAM

Nate Ruess
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
as you pour yourself, another drink, yeah

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shinin in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too farrrrrr

Eminem
I went in head first, never thinkin about who what I said hurt
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far
Cleaning Out My Closet and all them other songs, but regardless I don't hate you cause ma
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm, and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
equivalent to chemical warfare, and forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree
don't mean shit to me, you're kickin me out It's 15 degrees
and it's Christmas Eve, Little prick just leave Ma, let me grab my fuckin coat
Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each other's throats
Especially when dad he fucked us both, we're in the same fuckin boat
You'd think that it'd make us close nope further away it drove
us, but together headlights shine and car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old
And, that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though   but

Eminem
Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
But I'm sorry momma for Cleaning Out My Closet, at the time I was angry, rightfully maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
Cause, now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin jokes
That song I'll no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan bein placed in a home
and all the medicine you fed us and, how I just wanted you to taste your own
But, now the medication's taken over, and your mental state's deterioratin slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us BOTH
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have cause
One thing I never asked was, where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from ME That you coulda bet your asses
if I had to come down the chim i ney dressed as Santa
Kidnap 'em, and although one has only met their grandma
once, you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leavin to get some hamburgers
and as you left I had this, overwhelmin sadness
come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back and I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
thank you for bein my mom and my dad so
Mom please accept this as a tribute, I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
my seatbelt, I guess we're crashin
So if I'm not dreamin, I hope you get this message that I
will always love you from afar   cause you're my ma

Nate Ruess   Eminem
I want a new life start over one without a cause clean slate
So I'm comin home tonight yeah well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down, or if the crew can't wake me up
Well just know that I'm alright; I was not afraid to die
Oh even if there's songs to sing, well my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright; I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my lil' girls so I'll never say, goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright; I am not afraid to diiiiiiie

Nate Ruess
I want a new life

Yeah, I was tryin to figure out, the difference
But I think, I think the lines are startin to get blurred

Eminem
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e, when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged, in these chains and restraints
Grimmin every stranger in the place, while I gaze into space
Cause I'm mentally, rearrangin his face
I need a change of pace   cause the pace I'm workin at's dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roastin 'em
Cause that's where most of my anger is based/baste
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt you, aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanye's, Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's
I'm frustrated cause ain't
no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of wack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm goin all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is I'm strapped
for battles, sucka duck, crawl out the back
It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal, and beware of bar stools
flyin through the air and bottles breakin, mirrors also
And I ain't stoppin 'til the swear jar's full
You done called every woman a slut, but you're  Forgetting Sarah, Marshall 
Palin Oh, my bad, slut
And next time I show up in court, I'll be naked, and just wear a law suit
Judge be like, That's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you
Smart ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones you, sexy motherfucker
You're so fuckin gravy Marshall; I should start callin you  au jus 
Cause alls you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change change but only for the worse
So satanic K Mart chains panic, cause they can't even spin back the curse words
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screamin fuck, shit, fuck~ Adult with a childish like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like Merits
Fuck that I'd rather be loud and I like swearin
From the first album, even the gals were like Tight lyrics
Dreamy eyes, but my fuckin mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
opposition felt the opposite, sometimes I listen
and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches
to make sure I keep up with my competition
Haha, hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines   where I'm at
And the way I feel now, feel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies

But that ain't me, it's my evil twin
Blame him, it's my evil twin

Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend.
You have slept for quite some time.

Eminem
So who's left Lady Gaga Mess with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fuckin with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my album's just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3's, feel like I'm burnin to death but I'm freezin
Bed ridden and destined never to leave the
bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath, uh
Ledger, my suicide note's barely legible, read the
bottom, it's signed by The Joker, Lorena said I never can leave her
She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit bitch, give up my dick for pussy
I'll be Jerry Mathers, I ever  Left It to Beaver 
Get them titties cut off, tryin to mess with a  Cleaver 
Golly Wally I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 19946 Dresden it was definitely my
destiny when on the steps, I met Deshaun
at Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes while I wrote rhymes tryin to get props for 'em
Cause I took book smarts, and swapped for 'em
They were sleepin, I made 'em stop snorin, made 'em break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip top form
Since N.W.A was blarin through my car windows leanin on the horn
Screamin Fuck tha Police like COP PORN
Flipped rap on its ear, like I dropped corn
Fuck Top 5 bitch, I'm Top 4
And that includes Biggie and 'Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin, so who the fuck you think that third and that fourth SPOT'S FOR
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him
And I'm  nuts , then again who the fuck wants a  plain Eminem 
But no one's insaner than Slim
Hi Faggot, look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict/attic, and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me
that I should call the loony police, to come get me
Cause I'm so sick of bein the truth, I wish someone'd finally admit me
to a mental hospital with Britney
OHH LMFAO, no way, Jo 
se Baez couldn't beat this rap, O.J. no
Hooray, I'm off the hook
like Casey Anthony, hey hoe, HEY HO
I sound like I'm tryin to sing the fuckin chorus to Hip Hop Hooray No
I'm hollerin, you got bottom end like an 8 0 
Let your low end raise, yo
Tango What you think hoe Slow dancin or bowling
You tryin to hold hands with your homie
What You think I'm lookin for romance cause I'm lonely
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Hoe, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke, cause you don't work
Haha, but all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
And blamed it on him, when they tried to criticize
Cause we are the same, bitch

Don't fr fr front

Eminem
Used to get, bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pit Bull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken, I
begin to spittin like vintage 'Pac demented
Demonic sinister, ever since the Doc replenished
me the day he gave me that shot when I was just about to quit
So to not see him with, me would be a shocking image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxing critics
know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me broccoli, spinach, cocky Nope, but I hope I offended
you when I told ya how dope I am at this
And put emphasis on the dope so when names come up
in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
you won't find anywhere, when it fires and I unload, my pen explodes
'til there's no rhymes in it   reload in no time
Let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by so you know I meant it/minute
... In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
beggin my mom for K Mart MacGregors cause those were new
Saint Vincent de Paul, those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kiss them old days adios, I did it
They said I was a gimmick, now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go startin no argument
Cause you know I'll win it, name a flow that's mo' authentic
And don't front

Don't front, you know I gotcha open
Don't front, you know I gotcha open kid
Don't front, you know I gotcha open kid
Don't front, you know I gotcha open kid
Don't front, you know I gotcha open, word
Don't front, you know I gotcha open kid
Don't front, you know I gotcha open kid
Don't front, you know I gotcha open kid
Yo why you frontin You know I gotcha open kid

Eminem
Rest in piece to Big Proof, you was a beast
You lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowin through me
I love you Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne, better watch the fuckin tone that you speak
Feel like I'm in a zone, I'm in a whole different league
On my motherfuckin own, it's just me
No opponents can compete, and I've never been known to retreat
from beef, beep beep, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as FUCK, but can't even say bon appetit
Cause I don't know what to eat, fuckin microphone or the BEAT
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine, it's nose to the grind 
stone time holmes, your mind's blown cause I rhyme
like I'm still tryin to get signed
Up in the Ebony Show case with Denaun screamin Who the fuck passed you the mic
Never asked you like my shit from the git
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice, run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first, cause on the mic
I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their motherfuckin skills crackin
Word to Buckshot and Dru Ha, why the fuck not You don't like it Suck a cock
Almost forgot, before I signed with the Doc
I almost signed with DUCK DOWN
Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers and motherfuck Loud, they jerked me around so what's up now
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound
like rubbin it in and holdin some grudge now
But don't front

Eminem   Buckshot
Late at night used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write, the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers cause you might
leave a streak, I'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher which cypher I might jump in tonight
Cause I'm hyper or somethin, needin someone or somethin is light 
ing the fire under me, it's breathin new life
It's like I already died once, I guess some people only live twice
And it's funny, my days of bein broke are so long ago, I lost all concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fuckin nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm havin a stroke of genius, Elizabeth I'm comin to you honey
Uhh, from boy to man
And still make a whore moan/hormone like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category man
Don't group me up with them pop stars, I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense, YES offense
Precedence has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against, Moby's nose
Shout to Obie, the  Curtain's Closed  on my  Show 
But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it You can't take it, OHH
Got a whole generation of rappers comin up that are nutty with the flow
But convince me you've heard, an MC since me who's this good with the fuckin mincing of words
without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Whose as mentally disturbed, you might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin bein Indian burned
Ahh, bitch there isn't one, when will you learn
Never been served if memory serves
I'll battle THAT, 'til my own recollection remembers these words
Don't front

You know I gotcha open kid, yo stop frontin
You know I gotcha open, word life

Eminem
Girl you give me writer's block, I'm at a loss for words
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge, never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost That's what I call a cause to splurge
You drive me bonkers, I'm about to get my swerve on for sure
date cause I think  I Gave You Power , when I gave you flowers
in a vase, a box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
to talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should've been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man we jumped in too fast, cause since then I just can't be apart from her
Cause nobody's body's awesomer
I lust her and she loves me cause I'm popular
But you know this ain't love

You know this ain't love   ohh no
You know this ain't love
You know this ain't love   ohhhh no
You know this ain't love what is it then
It's desperation She's lookin for Mr. Right
Hey Wants me to be that guy to her
It's desperation I can't even put up a fight
Hey Cause I give in at the sight of her   and here I go again

Eminem
You were obviously oblivious to me, I
swore I was just invisible to you 'til I went to the lengths I did to meet ya
Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning now I'm in disbelief I
never knew that this could be such misery, ah
Cause now you see nothing but me and
I don't see nothing but you and I'm about to flip cause we are
super glued in We stuck to, each other's hips and we can't
do anything individually which is to cling on, scared to be a 
lone, can't specifically de scribe it, I just can't seem to give a reason
that's definitive, just need ya, talkin 'bout I live and breathe ya
And you pretend to be as mentally and 
physically addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you, don't wanna be with you neither
Bitch put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek cause
This ain't love

Eminem
I just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else, ah
What the fuck you whispering for
You get on my nerves, you make me sick I think our, relationship it seems to
be on the fritz, I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine, I think you need to
finish developing a little more mentally too
Get the picture That's a negative Alicia
I will never give the  Keys  up to the crib ever again, no Visa
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's, ya
better have an epiphany slut, guess what What The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to disco 
ver you were usin me for loot like I used you for looks, hoe thought you was too good for me, huh
Yeah, toots used to be my, Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin you, I'm not coming back
She said The fuck with that, where's my Louisville Slugger at
She grabbed that fuckin bat and swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's
when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, it would've put a 100 yard field goal through the uprights

Jamie N Commons
It's desperation

What is a nightmare

Eminem
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'til one day I grew suspicious
when I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be ditchin
Missouri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom please stick to a decision   discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor bitchin, and rules are Krypto 
nite, so the walls I done lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, runnin through the kitchen
Pretendin to be blind Superman, cause I had no super vision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into Invisible Kid
Disappear outta sight like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different
music into the picture and it became my new religion

I remember it clearly, even today.

Eminem
Move back to Michigan again, to live with
my Grandma Nan, always itchin for somethin to do, was flippin
through the radio stations one day and discovered this DJ who was mixin
I'll say it to this day, if you ain't listened
to The Wizard, you ain't have a fuckin clue what you was missin
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doin's wishin
for shoes, fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition
Troops, you get them LL Cool J coolin systems
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover and somehow I saw my future is in
this, that's how I knew my mission
Little boombox boomin, spittin, practicin numerous writtens
When I sit in my room envisionin my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit, couldn't wait to play him my new shit he'd go cuckoo ballistic
Go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant, we touched a mic that both of us two existed
to do this shit, never quit, too persistent

We are the underground empire.

Eminem
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all band together, there ain't no stoppin this shit
Come up with aliases, bi polar opposites and
be ready to come off the top with sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop cause if they caught you slippin
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin you, and you forgot your written
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knockin again
It tried ding dong ditchin shit, I fuckin got that bitch in
a headlock, cut off his oxygen Slim
It's not budgin like cocksuckin cinder blocks in the wind, now I got a pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, coppin over the opposition
Lookin like a dog that's pissin, leg up on the competition
Promisin complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in the league Muhammad's in, Ali's my colleague, bombin 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em, stompin 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian/rushin like a Ukrainian LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's FACE
So name the time, place to battle bitch, I'm still in that mindstate
Don't make me step on you and make you whine/wine, grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words
is loose but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now where's your poop, birds Ooh, no more drippin in bird shit
This song's a self empowerment surgin
words of encouragement, but discouragin
the rappers, the rap game's God but the name's not James Todd, I'm just a word Smith
So let these words lift
more merciless than the first is, and you ain't gotta wear no shoes and shirt
in this bitch to get served, bloodthirst, revenge of the nerds chka

Know too, that you'll not escape my vengeance

Eminem
And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turnin into an non humble don
You blonde dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So start the show but I need a drumroll 'fore I go ON
Better back away from the front row, get launched, show you I'm
bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo on the fuckin Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaats
I'll leave you stretched out like a fuckin YAWN
So mow the fuckin LAWN, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fuckin up this whole landscape of rap
The GOAT just ate eight acres, and eighth of that
was just to make a path and take it straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook looks smoke cooked
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove soot
Charred debris floatin like oak wood
was burnin, return of the no good
And I won't quit

And the next thing I knew something came crawling up from below.
Something that made Godzilla look like a plain cat.

Eminem
And it don't quit, won't change, it's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around y'all, cause you may, sayin bye bye y'all hey
I'm a monster, mush   I'm a monster, mush
I'm a monster, mush   I'm a, ohh
Turnin into a monster, mush
I'm a monster, mush   with my

Sam Kinison sample
DICK IN YOUR MOUTH ALL DAY Haha

I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came,
but the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed.

I can feel the heat risin, everything is on fire
Today's a painful reminder, of whyyyyy of whyyyyy
We can only get brighter, the further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside I'm on the inside
Lookin out cause

I'm Standin in the flaaaaames
And it's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Eminem
Yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake to start the mournin process
and rebuildin, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass, uh
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poke its eye out with the thorn bush that ya
used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is
stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas ped 
al and hit the corner fast, the
more assertive never lookin back may hit the curb but every day's a new learning curve as ya
steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have ta
to avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
and threw dirt on your casket, but you've returned from the ash 
es and that hurt that you have, you just converted to gas 
oline and while you're burnin the past, stand in that inferno and chant

Eminem
You're so familiarized with what havin to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died, cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep cause you're weakened
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin
It begins, to seep in, that's the only thing keepin
you from leapin, off the mother freakin, deep end
And I'm pullin for you to push through this feelin
And with a little time that should do the healin
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willin to forgive 'em
even after all that shit you've been put through, this feelin of resilience is buildin
And the flames are burnin quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in but you're fire proof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin
You look down cause you're so over 'em, you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal but scars still remainin the same
But tomorrow today's goin down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze
So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief, as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watchin the walls melt in your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin hell
Still a little piece of you dies as you scream

Sia
I, feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I, have learned, from fighting fights that weren't mine
Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly
And

I'm gettin by with my wicked ways
I'm loadin up and I'm takin names
I wanna   DIG MY WAY TO HELL
I wanna   DIG MY WAY TO HELL

Eminem
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder, ever heard of Aspergers It's a rare condition
It's what you're sufferin from when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no fricken air conditionin and you can't see the bitch's hair is frizzin
Cause you got the windows up blarin the system in your Chevrolet Prism
The devil ain't on the level same as him, picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him givin him an adjective an ass whippin so bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs like they did somethin to me personally
Used to get bullied so I cut class and ditch it   now I bully rap, I'm the shit, bag it sniff it
Cadillac from a K car, my ass from a hole in the ground, still can't tell 'em a part
Came straight out the trailer park screamin I'm proud to shop at K Mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad at the same Walmart arguin over the same cart
in the middle of the aisle whylin, I don't give a fuck, I don't play
Bitch you think you saw this basket first Your ass backwards like motherfuckin Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say, mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gapin hole in it, flipped out, ripped down the drapes
Tied 'em around my neck, went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates, so Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
And this ain't got nothin to do with a scale of bein gay little faggot, but by the way
Thoughts are gettin darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator and Violent Jay
It's a fuckin miracle to be this lyrical, paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
I'm insane, every rhyme I say, sons/suns you like an ultraviolet ray
I'm sellin hatred buffet style, all the shit you can eat, $11.99 so come on and pile a plate
I'm throwin down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise with the rhyme I'm spittin
while I'm shittin on competition, in the meantime it's always mean time, I'm gettin

Eminem
I've been a career asshole, I don't see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake but I was put here not by ac 
cident, I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish, slaughter tracks
I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit, I'm comin to get that quarter back
like Ndamukong, the drama can build, your momma can ask me for my autograph
Cause that cougar's a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book but I sure would fall for THAT
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight, when I get on the mic I'ma SNAP
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital when I overdosed woulda caught a FLAT
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid, indigestion, my suggestion's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm runnin away with the game it's cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways, lady you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches
Cry 'til you get puffy eyes, red face, but I'm leavin on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead and I'm sick of poundin a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage overhead space
Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods, other words don't try to put your heart in a headcase
Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed, I'm goin blind, I don't see my legs
I keep on fallin down, no wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting, if you felt these migraines
And see these maggots eat my brain, this G I A 
N T hole in my empty head, if you read my mind you can see my pain
Then you'd see why I be this way, ever since I was knee high playin
with G.I. Joes, told these hoes shut their P I E holes, now peep my game
Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it like a like a fuckin fuckin echo echo
Psy psycho on a cyclone cycle spiraling, h h here I go, I`m outta control like no
o o o other mic go, stab you 'til the knife goes
d d dull, I'm nothin but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
Cause I'ma sock it/socket to you Dyke hoe
You don't like it, get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle and ride it, like a motorbike
And hi ho, hand me my shovel, I'm liable to dig my hole
deeper and it's off to H E double hockey sticks I go
I'm gettin

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

Eminem
Fuck it
Why, are expectations so high
Is it the bar I set My arms I stretch
But I can't reach, a far cry from it
Or it's in my grasp but as, soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip, like the flyin trapeze
Into the dark I plummet
Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark's high, butter 
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin that no matter what bars I come with
you're gonna harp, gripe and
As pressure, increases, like khakis
I feel the ice cracking
Because

Eminem
Shit...
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers discs set
Will this step, just be another misstep
to tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
... I've garnered
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin the mark
'til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, This shit is garbage
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin to strip me of my confidence, mission accomplished
I'm not God sent, Nas, Rakim
'Pac, Big, James Todd Smith and I'm not Prince
So

Beyonce
Cause I'm only human, just like you
Makin my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me, the way that you do
Cause I'm terrified to let you down, ohh

Eminem
It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile yes, I goof and I jest
... A flawed human I guess
But I'm doin my best, to not ruin your ex 
pectations and meet 'em but first
He's goin too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin out my palm
Every album's song, I was spazzin the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's lookin down on me that matters, now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long
... Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades, and the Dresden home
is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone, and it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin the set, I'm still pokin my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme
Outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind
I might go outta mine, cause how do I
ever let this mic go without a fight
when I made a fuckin tightrope outta twine
... But when I do fall
from these heights though I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time
around cause

Beyonce
Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been makin my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me, the way that you do
Cause I'm terrified to let you down, ohh
If I walked on water, I would drown

Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm god like
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote Stan

Eminem
Instinctive nature, to bring the anguish yeah to the English language
With this ink you haters get rode/wrote on, like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travellin place to place, you barely
leave your house, cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta ride/write it out write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin foul, that's why you sound
so shook, wire bound notebook got tied around your throat, hook it inside your mouth
Go hruh, that's what it's like when the mic is out
Cause I'm tearin at your flesh with it, 'til your laryn x and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons expert with, like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin death of it, bitch you're starin at a legend that
in a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped to a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record bitch
Finger's so high in the air I'll bet your senses flip, like a barometric pressure switch
... Carin less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow bitch

I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin reckless, reckless yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin to lose, what can I do
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin to chew
Somethin to chew, somethin to chew

Eminem
Yeah, uhh, and still conjoined at
the hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is, in this field and still no filter boy
I'll put you in your place yeah like a realtor boy, you still ain't in the building boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it, get the drill bit
Pen is filled with poison, which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
Like what Like a real thin joint it what comes on Quilted Northern
In what In a built in toilet
Yeah Bitch, I told you I'm a dog woof I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin these fairies tails, should write a children's storybook yeah yeah yeah
Million voices in my head but still get a little bit of, thrill, and some real enjoyment
Off what Off the feel of going in
Like Like your bitch when she gives me BRAIN like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and, blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed, she makes iller noises, when she's with me
Must be from the Windy City huh, pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin me
Cause I conned her into, rippin the condom in two, woo
Dick is a bargainin tool, now I'm gettin blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't Well, I'll still have a few views
in common with you, just not YouTube, cause

Eminem
You're a has been, that has been the case since back when you last went
and threw your hat in the race, you've been trash bitch stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my, next rhyme you're a, fuckboy so, next time
It's gonna be heads flyin like Dez Bryant with a TEC 9 against Rex Ryan yeah
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I, clock rejects into the next life
Talkin reckless but it's just my, strongest suit but you can get my
Columbian necktie, prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe, girl you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribe, ending your life to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night and I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
Hup What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck, finds a slut
Tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up, binds up, cuts, slices her
twice but the muff diver must just like it rough, fuck right in her vagina, blood
Enthusiast of the roofie, goal is to get a floozy inside the jacuzzi
And have a loosey goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi see
But I am to rap, what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen, glued we be
I'm truTV, you're too PG, I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee
No diss there, just notice there are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married, to rap and I'm glad that we buried, the hatchet
and patched it up, now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your motherfuckin throat like

Hands up, officer don't shoot
Then pull up your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

Eminem
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, profile, then we wonder why we see this side of youuuu
Probably comin from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin that Heidi Klum
on you, another drug charge homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to
unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do
I keep tellin myself keep doin like you're doin
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue, time to go find a new
one and split his head right in two, no one's ever indicted you
Why Cause you're a

White boy, white boy, you're a rock star
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
Nobody can tell me shit cause I'm a

Eminem
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at
Why you kickin that soda can
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
throw your ass in the van cuffed, you don't have to know our plans
or what our intentions are, our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin a crime war
Here come the swine, tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talked to like you're just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and, get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in 
to the '60s, havin
black skin is risky cause this keeps happenin
Throughout history African Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit there have been times where it's been embarrassin
to be a

Eminem
Seems like, the average life span of, a white man
is more than twice than a, black life span
I, wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checkin out on life, can't e scape, this circumstance
I'd rather, hear 'em say Die N word, than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped
Cause we're strapped financially and can't find answers
We're applyin but McDonald's, seems to, be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
black eyes on the movement, which makes black lives madder
at cops, and cops madder
That's why it's at a, stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more, black cops, the crap stops
The block is our back yards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us
Man, you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops, fuck it up, for the good cops
And man stop, sendin white cops
into black neighborhoods, who ain't acclimated to 'em
Like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin videos of rappers wavin guns
Ain't know nobody black, so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist, wait, why are there black neighborhoods
Cause America segregated us
Designated us to an area, separated us
Section Eight'd us, when we tear it up's
the only time attention's paid to, us, and education, sucks
And every day's a no ther Freddie Grey for, us
A levy breaks or, fuzz, why is it
They treat us like dryer lint
We just want a safe environment for our kids, but can't escape the sirens
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
the poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
the lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we're trapped in, these racial biases
that plague our society, which makes our anxiety levels raise
every time we see a devil's face
Lions, tigers and bears, oh my; it's more like billy clubs and, gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty cause we're, black
But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's, caps, for silly stuff like, hats
Single mother strugglin through substance abuse
while people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots
And streets act as a narrator
Don't gotta read comics, or be that into characters
Just to see that, just to be black, you better be strapped with a derringer
Or be  Capped in America , like Steve Rogers
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
... Just keep marchin
... 'til we reach Congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin to take an irrational stance
if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they called it a Kaepernick tantrum
if you don't stand for the National Anthem
We raise it, you better praise it or you'll be made to feel
like a traitor we'll, treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still, racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
that had its Natives killed
Got you singin this Star Spangled spiel
to a piece of cloth that represents the  Land of the Free  that made people slaves to BUILD

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washin over me
Well little one, I don't want to admit to somethin
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are fallin like the rain
So let the river run

Eminem
He's comin home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet pack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin onto the next Ac 
tually, just shit on my last chick, and she has what my  Ex Lacks 
Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back, knife in hand
Says their relationship's hangin by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man/Spider Man
And I know she's usin me, to try to play him
I don't care, hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said Bye Suzanne
after the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washin over me
Well little one, I don't want to admit to somethin
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now are fallin like the rain
So let the river run

Eminem
A one night stand, turned to two night stand
It was Come sunlight, scram, now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
Cause he left, so what He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the stu 
dio like hole in the wall diners, don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turnin into's
irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you, took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin the wound, cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
to use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck

Eminem   Ed Sheeran
My name's ohh my name's ohh
River ohh river run
Call me ohh call me ohh
River ohh, we'll let the river run
Always the bridesmaid, never The bride, hey
Fuck can I say If life was a highway
and deceit was an enclave, I'd be swervin in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin on ice, maybe
That's why I may, have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate, my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child

I'm sorry
I fucked up

Eminem
Yeah... damn girl
Do I drive you crazy
You make me crazy too
You make me do things
I normally wouldn't do
You make me feel things
That I ain't ever felt
You gotta be the real thing
Cause you remind me of myself

Eminem
Yo...
I bust in, devilish grin, disgusting
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin
Get on the floor when I pop up on some Whac A Mole shit
In search of a chick who's stacked and so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go with
I spot you at first glance and go Shit
You're wearin those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up, that's why you stick it out no matter what
Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp and blow
You just laugh and go   Heehee
Cause you're just as nasty so, that's appropriate
That's why

You know, I'm wearin a new shirt tonight too yo
With me on it

Eminem
I'm lookin at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty, like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin Jack and Beam, I'm thinkin soon as trampoline so we should bounce
But you're out of your tube top
If you're thinkin that mi casa es su casa
Yeah you're a cute fox, perfect ten so, back that up like a moonwalk
Girl you're smokin, like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin/token, if you think you're takin over my quarters
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So Rick, scratch on the break, like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why

Eminem
Shorty you the shit, girl I order you to sit
I know you're probably feelin me, more than you admit
Pull up a chair sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones...
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Besides, you're fired up
like a starter pistol, crystal and slide hun, tonight I'm your pilot
Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fuckin fly, you belong in the mile high club
So c'mon baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high strung
We might wind up, unbound like we're tryin for the Cy Young
Fuckin 'fore we get to the house, screwin our brains out
Like changin a lightbulb, that's why I like ya
Cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes babe, I'm fallin in likeness kinda, why I love

Alice and the Glass Lake
I've drowned in high from the ashes
Now, I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything'll grasp
at ends, of what's left over
And the lights in every broken
blown out window, screaming, laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revival

Yeah, shout to everybody
who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

Eminem
Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and, heroism meets, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet
He's tryin to divide us
The shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only  Unite us 
Cause nothin inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pried/pride from
When we can't from our stars and stripes cause
This type of pickle that we're in's hard to dill/deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch, like a scab, get the scars to heal
And, band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill his wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter, let's start from zero
This is our renewal, spray tan get rid of
Get a brand new better America, and here's to where we are

And here's to where we all began, all began stand up
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am hands up
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only, place that really know me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

Eminem
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya
Can't denounce the Klan cause they play golf wit ya
You stay on Twitter
Way to get your hate off Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards bigot, the swastika with your name carved
in it should be your trademark, cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos, so basically you're Adolf Hitler
But you ain't ruinin our country, punk
Or takin our pride from us, you won't define us
Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin up
so much, got a sprained neck, know we will rise up
against this trainwreck, and take a stand
Even if it means sittin when they raise the flag
to sing The Star Spangled Banner
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady National Convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand at
the event, or maybe had the wherewithal
to know that he was gonna try to tear apart
our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
the start of a brand new America
without him, and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we are

Alicia Keys   Eminem
I won't give up
I won't give up on my home that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home that so many died for
You already know, there's no place like home
No place like home, wherever I go
No place like home, no place like home
No place like home, wherever I go yeah

Eminem
We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage need a luggage rack, but we carry on with our public spats
And our feud's up, back in the news; love taps when I dissed you
like it was fun, actually used to run, back to the booth, jump back in the studio
Give you a tongue lashing then you, laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb 
stone, it was funny back in our youth, but then it wasn't after we knew
that we were done, and actually through actually through
But if there's one, fraction of truth, if it could be spun, back I would do
so many things different, cause it was such, a dumbass excuse
You hit me once, and that I would use to continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I'm confused
Because

How come, you can be a lord and a loser
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father, a great dad, but a bad husband

Eminem
You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot   we laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie, day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady, or by the phone for Mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on givin it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod, when my sky gets dark, I'm your shiny rocks
in that tiny box when we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed, we were supposed to not, every time we fought, the insults that got
thrown too far, words that we said that we didn't mean, the words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said, letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead and had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin still if I said I wasn't sittin here askin myself

Forever be a hero, in my eyes I reply
But there's always another side
to a good father, a great dad, but a bad husband

Eminem
We brought out the worst in each other, someone had to make the sparring end
Cause I loved you but I hated that me, and I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry Kim, more than you could ever comprehend
Leavin you was fuckin harder than, sawing off a fuckin body limb
Once upon a time we're all we had, maybe that's what drew us to each other, it was true love
Shit we never knew was possible, we might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other, all the screw ups
cause you always thought that you was
more in love with me and I was thinkin I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked, 'til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve, all I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search, to find the words
and thoughts, the purpose was not, to stir up, or open wounds, I've caused a few
And so have you, or argue whose, fault it was, partly yours
Partly mine, but really no one's, this is so tough, I'm gettin choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck; we broke up, got back together
We both thought, we had forever, not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, back stabbed each other, another blow struck
But there's no duckin this blow cause, it's over, and it's closure
But, I'm not so sure how to close this, I just don't know
how some people can be so good at one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
Shit, it's no wonder

X Ambassadors
How come

Eminem
Feelin kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's Freaky Tales biatch
Havin creepy visions of whiskey drinking
Envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna  stick  her like she decals
But when murdering females, better pay attention to these details
or you could be derailed, better wear at least three layers
of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll, be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams I remember distinctly, I said I'm here to do sink repairs
Chop her up, put her body parts in front of Steven Avery's
trailer and leave 'em there
But hey man

I was, FRAAAAAMED, I know what this looks like
Officers, please just give me one minute
I think I can ex PLAAAAAIN, I ain't murder nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to enter TAAAAAIN, How come your shirt is so bloody
There's a missin person, so what He's
got nothing, to do with, MEEEEE
I'm almost certain I was, fraaaamed

Eminem
Woke up it was dawn, musta knew somethin was wrong
Think I'm becomin a monster cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on as the Tonka Truck in the yard
But dawg, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, cause it's incumbent upon
me, plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
girl, that motherfuckin baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin newspaper articles, cuttin up sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
'Nother dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
Cause the disassembled body was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me
But hey man

Eminem
Still on the loose they, spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap lookin like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J The cops is on a goose chase
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked when I break in your basement
Under your baby's playpen, I lay and wait adjacent
Facin the door, remaining patient while staying complacent, blatant
Sexual implications are continuing to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in, little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint hoe, I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
with the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No officer, you see

Ashes blowin in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin back and we're never gettin old
Cause the skies are black but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin what you're told
We're goin nowhere fast

Eminem
I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin me back, down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact, I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and, fast
Another terrorist, attacks, like a tariff, blows half
of Madison Square up, alas, we perish, in the blast
But that isn't scarin us, we pass knowin we're fearless
Cause we're just

Ashes blowin in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care we don't give a yeah no
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin back and we're never gettin old
Cause the skies are black but our heart's made of gold golden
Fuck doin what you're told what we're told
We're goin nowhere fast
Cause we're goin no, goin no, goin no
Goin no, goin no, goin nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin nowhere fast

Eminem
Fuck doin what you're told, act like a 2 year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways, for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin this rhyme, cause I'm a wake and you're mourning/morning
That's why I rise and I shine, like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot, I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
Cause some stuff that's awful, really don't mean nothin although
There's a lot of, shit I said in jest, that's tough to swallow
... But if at times my heart it seems
like it's in the wrong place, it's probably cause, it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves,  Speed  of life, avoid or veer or just steer
toward it, we're only lookin forward, but where we're goin, we have no idea
Nowhere to go but hysterical, it's gettin warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit, but I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch   War Machine
But you forced me in a corner, I'm sure to, have somethin for your rear
And in the course of the assault this torture, gets more severe
Go to war with me you'll end up blew to Timbuktu, I'll send at you
a 10 ton nuke like Kim Jong Un and end up ruinin your Korea/career
All in all, this is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off That day'll never come
To the pine box bitch, fuck you I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does but, I'm not gonna sweat it cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked, and I'm on top, so everyone's just

Eminem   Kehlani
You can't, tell us nothin
Hard headed, and we're stubborn
So, one ear, and out the other
When we're young, we're young, we're young
On the run of our lives
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter, uh oh
On the run of our lives
No more tomorrows, we're done, we're done
And all we are is

Eminem
You claim if you get knocked by the cops you'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment, shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless, I'll just call it shotty/shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin faded on molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted, probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin to claim it, bitch stop bein a lame
Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin body limbs, like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
and chainsawing them in the basement, hardly fits your job description, ain't nobody dippin
out the back the club like, Oh my God, he's trippin Only time you get the blade is
probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
... I need to stop bein debated
You're still copyin, xeroxing, I'm still coppin a feel like Bill Cosby
at will, poppin a pill, then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fuck's reprehensible misconducts
Never sensible, kiss my butt, my set of principles is gone but
'til I get the President to respond my, pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell, just as big of a bitch as Donald, shit's on bruh
Let me sing this shit soprano while I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff arm her, while I'm hittin on Melania
And this song's for all ya

Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
Cause you're only gonna make things worse I hope you offended
Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'til everybody eats my turds

Eminem
These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me, like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin ham at candied yam on nanny cam, I'm gettin handys with the zanny Xannys
in the Caddy armrest, I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs from a daddy long leg
In Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera, Xanax, a banana hammock 
and a Santa hat, I'm smellin like a damn mechanic, with a chick that looks like Janet Jackson
with a Spanish accent, twice your age and I'm, actin half it haha
... Grow up Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin overhaul, got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin all through those Kolonopins like a bowling ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol and go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to an interracial blow up doll
of Rachel Dolezal, you're so appalled/a Paul'd Em
So's my manager, bitch I am mature/amateur, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close so don't compare, they ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me... cause I don't own a mirror
But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it, do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
Your anxiety's throwin gang signs, but I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin back on women hate crimes, like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang bang bang bang time, dang knives are butcher than gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size as the blade I
push in to kaput ya when I, pull 'em like, sleigh rides
Gotta stab a, bitch at least eight times to make it on Dateline
I came to stake/steak my claim like a canine waitin in a buffet line
So Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre, come play
Belly dance on me, I've been making wedding plans all day

Eminem
8 year old with the wordplay, girl, take this pole/poll like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday but I'm, caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape, cause you're in a slurrin state
I'm a ten, you're an eight/urinate, like what I do before, after and during RAAAA 
You wanna get into a pissin contest and, find out who's better
And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him, R. Kelly with a full bladder
Non high school grad, I'm not a scholar but I'm so cold when I'm droppin knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college zero but nobody's hotter
You owe me my respect, I owe you nada like a Lodi partner, blow me, told you I'm so dirty homie
You can throw me in some holy water with some floaties on and get the soap and try to get the Pope to hold me
while you hose me off, and nope I won't be washed, you hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo', I won't put the sugar coating on it though
Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired, rap's
got you drained, dead tired, zapped, you feel like a wet pile of crap
But look man, like the Feds buggin my phone uh huh I get wire/why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back, catch fire, get upset and fire BACK
is what I tell myself, when times get bad
Cause sometimes I might get sad, well I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad   don't cry, get mad
Cause little baby pouters/powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hype but by the time you see this side of me, I'm right in your ass sodomy
'Fore the pen I stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school at his school
You ain't have to have no money or go shoppin just to cop a fuckin attitude attitude
Now my dough's amountin to a mountain, it's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it and I'm enraged, cause I just figured out that if I was paid
for the time I spent to put the pen to the page, it'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head, I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but I'm
never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood I
put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
will they put me on a pedestal or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever cause I'll never get
another motherfuckin opportunity again to offend
as many people with this I can simply, because I, can

Pnk
You're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home, and clean up your mess
What would you do without that
Why do I always come back
Ohh, what I, wouldn't, do for you

And I'm startin to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you, need, me
Yeah, me

Pnk
Some nights, I wanna run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile, as rare as it comes
What would I do without that
Maybe that's why I come back
Ohh, what I, wouldn't, do for you

Eminem
Startin to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raisin the other
You remind me of my mother, we drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults so there's no excuse for the games that we play with each other
Where you at At a friend's No you ain't, motherfucker
But I give her the benefit of the doubt whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver
when I touch her cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker, our bottom lip can quiver
When she's in trouble she's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin again, give her
'nother chance, 'nother one after that, I'm swimmin in that Egyptian river
Cause I'm in denial/da Nile, say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit eatin grin when I smile
Makin an excuse for us to act it out, she's just actin out, with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire cause I'd rather believe a lie than to breathe a sigh
of relief, I don't believe in, goin to bed mad, I keep on tryin
to make a bad girl good, but haven't I stood by you in good times
And bad I'm startin to feel like your goddamn dad, cause I literally feel like you could die
of a Should I, leave you for good so never would I
It'd be all bad, huh, never understood why they call it good bye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy   and you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you, change but I keep puttin my fuckin foot in my
mouth every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in amid trouble but I can't leave, I'd sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin back on you, what is that I'm co dependent
I'm just now noticin it, but somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart, our apartment's tore apart
You're usin my heart for a dart board, but God must've aligned stars for us
Cause somebody paired us up, and they say He ain't capable of makin a mistake
But this one's perfect cause I'm

In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie ie ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie ie ie ie, oh

Eminem
I'm packin up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin as far as I can get
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like Cause tonight, I'm startin life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin like holdin
your head up high when you're dead inside and I just hide, so in
case you're wonderin why are my insides showin
Cause I done spilled all my guts, and those are mine so I'm
pickin 'em up and stuffin 'em back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit,  Recovery  brought me nothin but back
to right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of  Relapse 

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie ie ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie ie ie ie, oh

Eminem
It seems, to be the reoccurring main thing, the shit I
would daydream as a kid I, was 18, I went
from an irate teenager to, still raging as an adult
Amazing, back then I put anything into the
rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry I spit it
The mainstream, I hit it, yay me, I did it
Did what Hailie, baby, I didn't
mean to make you 80 percent of
what I rapped about, maybe I shoulda
did a better job at separating Shady and enter 
taining from real life, but this dang thing is still the
hardest thing to explain, it's the craziest shit I
ever seen and back then it was like I ain't even
bothered taking into consideration
you one day being older and may hear me say things, I did it
Aim me, and be, just ain't me
Okay, so ladies and gentle 
men let's strip away, everything and see the main reason that I
feel like a lame piece of shit I sound cranky, and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things cause when I
look at me, I don't see what they see, I feel a 
shamed, greedy and lately I've been contemplating escaping to get a 
way and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy what's in my

I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter, you'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along, this is your song

I just want you to know that I ain't scared hmmm
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
to do whatever December 1st, 1995
To do whatever dear Hailie

Liz Rodrigues
This is your song

Eminem
You'll be comin out of mommy's stomach soon
I better do somethin quick if I'ma be able to support you
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
That's all that matters for the time being, but obviously
Assuming you will be, just thinking ahead, I'ma make it if it kills me
Let's see how far I can take it with this music
I'm gettin sick of chasing this illusion
Sorry for sloppy writin, the pen in my hand is shakin, please excuse me
Dad's a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm sayin rhymes and write 'em
with the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
as I'm using in this letter maybe they can feel me as I'm
trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to Mom and Dad's crazy world
Love, Daddy; maple flavored kisses, buttered pancakes and syrup haha

I just want you to know that I ain't scared ahem
Whatever it takes to raise you aight let's see I'm prepared
to do whatever December 1st, 1996
To do whatever dear Hailie

Eminem
You got your Momma's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, lil' minor mishap
But you'll grow into 'em baby, I'm on the grind now
I'm doin little shows, open mics, all nighters
at studios, while I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far
I just keep steerin, I'ma turn into someone
I haven't the slightest, clue what I'ma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talkin bad about Dad, it's tickin me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or somethin, ooh
I think I might've just stumbled onto somethin, new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hopin that you'll
open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

I just want you to know that I ain't scared ahem, aight
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared see, December 24th
to do whatever 2007
To do whatever dear Hailie

Eminem
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between them, since I rised to this fame
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang
I never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're bein punished
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
100% finished, fed up with it, I'm hangin it up, FUCK IT
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
that I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote
as a goodbye note, cause your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm slidin down a slippery slope, anyways sweetie, I better go
I'm gettin sleepy; love, Dad   shit, I don't know

Eminem
If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill, or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turnin so definite, wait
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you being, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt chasin I guess, it's arrivederci
Same nurse just heard say they're unpluggin me
And it's your birthday, Jade I'm missin your birthday
Baby girl I'm sorry, I fuckin hate when you hurt, Hai'
And sweeties, thank you for waitin to open gifts
But girls, you can just open 'em, Dad ain't makin it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell but nothin comes out, I'm cryin inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream but it's not aloud/allowed
You put your arm around Momma to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk you's down
Never see you, graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happenin now
I've got so much more to do
And Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new, for me for school
Doody I'm tryin, but you, you were the glue that binded
so many things; time, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
by pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night cause
that image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me fallin across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive but I'm dyin, where's Nathan
Little ladies be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me, just don't get sad when remembering
And little bro, keep makin me proud
You better marry that girl cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchangin those sacred vows, just know that if I could be there I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do somethin, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you, you taught me what not to do
And Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
to have one last heart to heart honest and open talk with you
Doody I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pullin tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset, I see them cheeks soakin and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly don't wanna let
me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
from this dream I, need to re find, my inner strength
to remind, me even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewindin the tape

Eminem
I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
100% finished, fed up with it, I'm hangin it up, FUCK IT
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
that I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledgin to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote, on that old pathetic loathing
Closing credits can roll, I'm proud to, be back
I'm 'bout to/two, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
with Recovery, Mathers LP 2, help propel me to, victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider them last four minutes as
the song I'da sang to my daughters
if I'da made it to the hospital less than two hours later, but I fought it
And, came back like a boomerang on 'em, now a new day is dawnin
I'm up, Tuesday, it's morning, now I know haha

Motherfuckers talkin crazy yeah sayin I should quit yeah
I fuckin tell 'em make me bitch eat a fuckin dick yeah
I'm feelin like the greatest woo one to be whoever did it
Mike Will the one who  Made It , it's Shady on the lyrics

Eminem
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth but I guess you fabricate, eh
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic, stay spray
at anything that may stand in they way as I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
and a tre eight at the Mandalay Bay, common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my cat scan that day, I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray; I'm turnin back to a madman, can't take
anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage, my basal ganglia is an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets, breakin your legs, ain't give aways ankle the ways
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin to give goosebumps a day when you say
that somethin you won't give someone a lump in their throat if you had them choked up you'd be yankin my chain
Feelin like I'm headed for a padded cell the, bar for me what I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to, but if somethin like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are, looked at as a failure
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper cause damn it I'm still the

Greatest in the world yeah greatest in the world yeah
Greatest in the world yeah no lie, I might be
Best to ever do it yeah best to ever do it yeah
Best to ever do it yeah I, feel like the greatest yeah
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good yeah never be as good yeah
Packin up wife beaters, white t shirts
But but I'm the greatest...

Eminem
So you sold 10 million albums, eh What
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh Haha Wait, what was I just about to say
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way, I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I misprounouced a name   DIE ANTWOORD Fuck, I still can't say this shit
But how quickly they forget who the fuck I was, now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let your girl get fucked by Muggs, I'd like to, give a shout to Cypress
This can't  Be Real , you dissed me and I was just tryin to give you a shout
Now get the fuck out my rhyme book, no more shiners, already too much time chokin rappers
I hear you talkin shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window, somebody better child proof it
Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit, you don't got the tools, I got my toolkit
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot that I'm so fuckin awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop, so you can call it a nostril cause it's not
gonna, ever, I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
Cause I'm wipin everyone up in this genre, cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

Eminem
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention what is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention, I love contentions
So welcome to the gun convention, muscles flexin, gotta strut like a front suspension
You just stuck the key up in the ignition and gave me enough gas to flood my engine
Yeah Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin up like a raft
I just slapped Vlad with a ISIS flag, bet you I come back twice as bad
Uhh Revival didn't go viral
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back 'til I run out of gun powder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze and I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips and the clips got the cig' lit like it's nicotine, trigger me and Slim gets mean
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes, that's why I call the motherfuckers Em 16's
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee, you ain't harmin a thing
I get a day hard as I'm gonna swing, I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band you gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
An anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali, cause I knew one day I'm gonna be the

Yeah yeah yeah Yo yo how do I keep
Man I don't know what's up with these hoes, man
Gettin in relationships like this I'm just sayin
Maybe it says somethin about me yeah, yup
Should I look in the mirror

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together

Eminem
She thinks I'm bein mean and now she starts to scream and shout, she's about to let the demons out
She don't wanna see me with other females out, I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin to leave the house in an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count, and all I can think is how

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein weird's normal

Eminem
And I don't know what's got a hold of me, most notably I've been zonin to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted, so much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's
the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin through her purse, I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's
heartless, no wonder we're partners, both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that, I slipped up and busted her jaw with
a Louisville Slugger cause all's it, really does is make our love
for each other grow stronger, she won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over, kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked And how the fuck did I get so twisted
I'm with someone so unlikeable and shifty, we're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing she's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep, bringin up that one time she, tried to two time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave, how could I, be so naive
Should I leave or turn this entire evening to a motherfuckin crime scene

Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with, him, you weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch
Especially when you're the one cheated first, now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it, complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it
... I love you but I hope you fuckin die though
In our business your friends like to pry so, you've got 'em all undercover just like moles
Hopin they'll come back with intel, but I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
through your iPhone, who the fuck's Milo The guy at work who drives a Hi Lo
I put a trackin device on your Chrysler and follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
I hit a light pole, you skrrt off and then pull up at 5 AM in the drive in a stretch white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole

Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal
Yeah, I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal

Take me to the river
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Eminem
It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin sales go through the roof
We wrote and we viewed it, Runyon Avenue Soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
We were so bullet proof; wrote, souped and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
... The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin they do so I ain't have to shoulder the crew
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
how to stand on they own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed the oomph was gone when we go in the booth
Cause the truth is the moment that Proof died, so did the group
Shoot

Turn to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
Cause on the way back down I may
end up runnin back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

Eminem
It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by the more life happens
And we gotta be men   we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel and I feel like this is what got us in
the debacle we're in, been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me Biz, Rockstar was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit, if
you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
more than try talkin you into comin up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers I wish
that we woulda politicked with, maybe y'all coulda clicked
And got you some features, but that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed

Eminem
Bacardi and Henn', never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is starting to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin cats and dogs in this bitch, to tiny drops, little drips
And by the time your reign/rain is over, you'll hardly be missed/mist
You start thinkin of all the artists you gift
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
for turnin your fuckin back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift
A Freudian slip, subconsciously I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt, and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none, I just wish
I had words but I guess, they're just, are none for this
To my, partners I can't say how, sorry I am
This is, not how I planned for our, story to end
I love, all of you man but I just, can't be that guy
every body depends on for entire careers
Cause that's, not even fair, I will, always be here
But that spark isn't there, and I don't know how to recapture
that time and that era, I've tried harkening back to
But I'm fightin for air, I'm barely charting myself
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
to treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind but we been, down every road
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend, livin this lie that we live
The less is left for closure   so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones

Fack Okay fack
How do I say this fack
Last year fack didn't work out so well for me fack
Fack last year fack
2018 fack well fack ha

Eminem
Yeah, I'm a fuckin kamikaze crashin into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul de sac, window cracked, bumpin your reference tracks
You you collaborative effort rap, I I have never said his raps
O overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it wrote it
While I teabag the microphone cause I go nuts on it on it
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun,  FACK  2017
Fack, fack on everyone, fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone   I'm a, kami kaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F 15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone, fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone   I'm a, kami kaze, gonna

Eminem
I turned to rap cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't wasn't
From the moment I heard rap was cussin, I was in was in
Which is why I identify with the guy who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a 9 volt, ice cold like snake eyes twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold ooh
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note, here come the guys in white coats
tryin to stop me 'fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
Cause I'm takin y'all with me when I go cyclone, I don't think this typhoon's
letting up any time soon, here I go, eyes closed, blindfolded
I'm 'bout to

Eminem
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee
That way that shit was so ass, it's somethin we wouldn't derrier/dare re air
And that shit's embarrassing as me rear ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an acorn, stairlift beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin every beat there is

Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin
Somethin evil is lurkin, I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin here is afoot   oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin stick what 12 inches of wood
Wait, but I've been goin for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects cause if you sleep you're fucked, other words
You get laid to rest, and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track I go cray on it like a color book
You got some  Views , but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You lyin through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot

You know
Everybody's been tellin me what they think about me for the last few months
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them

It's too loud
Can't hear it comin down the hallway stairs, from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it, slow fire

Don't fall on my face
Don't follow my faith, ohh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't follow my faith, ohh
Don't fall on my fate

Justin Vernon
Don't fall on my

Eminem
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
and that first marijuana tape, guess I got a  Chronic  case
And I ain't just blowin smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made Not Afraid
One last time for Charlamagne, if my response is late
It's just how long it takes to hit my fuckin radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games, one minute they're  Mocking Jay 
Next minute they get their style from Migos, 'til they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk on Water gate, I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin, I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once, you wanted Shady
You got it

Yeah
Line 'em up
Brrat Ha

Eminem
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped, the closest thing he's had to hits is smackin bitches
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again I'll have you twisted
like you had it when you thought you had me slippin
at the telly, even when I'm gettin brain you'll never catch me with a THOT, lacking with it
He ain't spittin like this on his last shit Hoe you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin I'll slow or let up, call it trap cause it's a
total setup hopin that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, Hold your head up Kathy Griffin
Stackin ammunition, slap the clip and cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead pew Gabby Giffords
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler  Create  nothin, I see why you called yourself a faggot bitch
It's not just cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack religious
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you put together
some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature when I stole the show ha
Sorry if I took  Forever  haha

Yeah, I won't
Line 'em up
Ha... it's too easy

Eminem
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you, make your run in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered; revenge is the best medicine, increase the dose
from least to most and then tell the Grammys to go
and fuck themselves, they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches so
they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em, see the show
Every parasite needs a host haha
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats yeah
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and the prayer
A beacon of hope, put a B I R D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin this while he lip syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
how I'm buryin these artists, on the scale it turns to minus
Mines is various as hardly and what's scary is you probably
can compare me to your car cause I'm just barely gettin started
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone, use your telephone
and go fetch me the remote, put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown, don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K Dots, the 5'9s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall, bitch yeah

Eminem
Here we go, aga in, from heroes
to villains, used to be your, Romeo, but we both
were jilted, a couple of times, so we had a slippery slope
to deal with, but still it, gave me hope
that we'll get, through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E N V E lope
Would be dope, but, what kind of lengths can you go
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn hoe
to be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin out my drive
I ran outside, why is she tryna act out She's just about my size
Hit me in the mouth twice, guys
When someone you'd die for, sticks a steak knife in
your heart, do you try more Another late night in
She stumbles through my door, lets the daylight in
And all we do's fight more, and I ain't violent
But she's goin through my drawers to plant the K Y in
I'm gettin accused by a whore, who smells like St. Ides and
who's probably screwed five more guys, sucked eight nine men
I'm takin two by fours, to our eight by tens
Bitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two ply for, when you date my friends
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get
I'm waitin for the day I can
hear you say, Marshall, what a skank I've been
And there's a new guy you're, bein replaced by him
Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
After you I swore, to make the gray skies end
Here come the rays like wind, you get a pay hike and
Am I the good guy or, do I just play like him
And hope that he dumps you
It's like a dream come true, just to scream Fuck you
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
Since

Jessie Reyez
Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
They'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
Even though you know the real me
You can't be the cheater, convince a non believer
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I let you say that you're the good guy
I yii, I yii
Cause this ain't what love looks like
I yii, I yii, I yii
You can't be the cheater, convince a non believer
I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I let you say that you're the good guy
I yii, I yii yii
They like, You're the good guy
They like, they like, they like, You're the good guy

Proof
You wish that you could bear me black
D12 standing back
No planning that
Def methods, we got a hand in that
Whoever run this shit
You get a jammed knee cap
Make the healthy get sick
And your fam handicapped
You a fan of rap
My clan attack
Your school, home, your bitch house
Pull my nine milli
You gon' die with your fist out
Him an his
It's over with
Venom is this
cobra spit
Agressive dialect with agressive
Sober bitch
My bionic fires demonish atlonics
Demonic is tainted chronic
Impossible to hold down like vomit
Mics I palm it
You stay to bomb it
Like tourists that's Islamic
I enter your atmosphere like a comet
The new god of rap
Call me nigga Thor
Snap your back
When I slap your ass in a figure four
From miles around they can feel it's lethal
I make hardcore groups like Wu Tang
Look like the Village People fags
No sequel
The general let the senistal
Abort your mind state and kill your inner child

Bizarre
It's been a while
Since you bitch niggas heard of me
Cuz the last six months
I been doing R&B
But now I'm on some sick shit
Niggas better duck quick
You don't know who you're fucking with
I'll leave you niggas breathless
Seeing me and Bugz rolling in the blue hummer
You a bitch, scared to shoot like Lindsay Hunter
Don't need to be a father
Cuz I'm just to illmatic
I'll probably poison my kids
Like flowers in the alley
Fuck your anorexic neglects it
Fuck a Lexus
I'm doing drivebys on XXX BMX's

Bugz
I know a girl who said she's prio
And her sign is a Leo
Bugzy fucked her in a Regal
And then she took me to my P.O.
Fuck rollin' ceelo
I'm down to a c note
Lost a g' rollin' dice at that punk ass casino
But fuck it shit cuz when times get bad
See me and drag with the mags
On unsuspecting fags bitch
I gotta shoot
Bitch you got the boot
And hurry up with it
I'm trying to catch this prostitute I got ten

Kuniva
I'm the nigga that spotted ya
Spit something hot at ya
Rip your Nautica
Saw you backstage and shot at ya
And kill subliminally
You can go on
And spin your group name 25 times in one song
I'll still write about you
Hip hop is better off without you
Blowing niggas outta they bathrobes
And funky house shoes
For the hell of it
I fuck Missy Elliott
Don't give a fuck if her belly gets
In my way, I'm still nailing it
Got this verbal tech nine
Spitting at you for telling shit
Get this dead body off the mic
I'm fuckin smelling it

Kon Artis
Fuck it
Let's have a scrub out
Fuck around with us and see what happen
We all got them guns blappin
Got y'all niggas back tracking
Ya, we dump bodies in seashores
Busting DJs over they backs with keyboards
Turn up my levels
Your crew is fruitier than pebbles
Changin you razor back MCs to running trebles
Bust up
Kon Artis, quick to smack your slut up
Keep a pack of rubbers
Just in case I gotta nutt up
Brigade style hold 'em out down
That's how it's meant to be
You kick the same shit
Your whole tape sound like a symphony
Don't say shit to me
It's DP carry your daughter
Talking bitches outta they panties
Dollars and last quarters
Like that horsemen
I'll leave your whack crowns hutless
Watch Defarius come to my show
And leave dreadless
Whoever said this slash rapper and producer
Wouldn't make your head twist
Guard your grill and your necklace

The saga starts right now
If you ain't down with us from this day on
Then fuck you

Kon Artis
I damage your neck
With the butt of the tech
Vandalous sex
Cuttin' you ear to ear
With the razor of my Gillette
You couldn't get respect
If you was a captain or a cadet
Granddaddy, daddy, or uncle who's a Vietnam vet
I'll battle you 50 deep
Solo artist shocker dead beat
Derelicts on the loose
Wylin' like thugs outta prison with slugs
While y'all start screaming
Like grasses in a submission
Lay down your pot to piss in
Blow up the house you live in
Believe me, we greedy
And often you is easy
Your whole album cheesy
Because you got platinum artists on it
Don't make it hot
We steamroll with real niggas
And that's something that you not
I'm vampin what you got
Then setting up camp at your spot
Foiling your plot
Every rhyme that you jot
I rock to the six like musty twat
A dead corpses that been cut up
And left in abandoned lots
Ya, derelicts theme
Comparing your team
To ours is a fucked up dream
The shit I done seen
Has turned me to a scandalous fiend
Sticking your peeps for cream
Gators or boots, nigga, I'm crushing your dreams
As foul as it seems
Dismantling spleens til your whole clique's
Walking funny like handicapped juggling teams
I rumble with kings
More humble with seen
Until it's time for me to kill again
Sincerely yours, the Kon Artis

Ay yo
Competition of none's such
Derelicts the one must
Let the guns bust
Brigade one trust
Untouched
Martyr a mic
Slaughter your life
Runnin avenue soldiers bitch
It's water and trife
Competition ain't none such
Derelicts the one must
Let the guns bust
It's Brigade one trust
Untouched
Martyr a mic
Slaughter your life
Runnin' avenue soldiers bitch
Smarter and trife

Bizarre
Who's the fat bastard
Rapping that mo' master
Snorting coke that's whiter than Casper
Better run faster
I can out smoke all of you motherfuckers
And bitch I was born with asthma
Fuck life, I'd rather track Jack Daniels
Smoke weed and rape Cockerspaniels
A peeping Tom, nigga I need Ridalin
Fuck girls
Bitch I only date senior citizens
Your grandma, nigga I'm the one that vic'd her
Next time you rush me
You better be a little bit quicker
Run your streets in the house
And make full of malt liquor
I'm lettin' you throw the first blow
And bring ten of your toughest niggas
End ya year
Like the last day of December
But did you rape that bitch
I was so drunk I can't remember
I used to be in a group
We had an argument who was the hottest
Now both them niggas is dead
And I roll as a solo artist

Kuniva
Look bitch you stressed out
I divide these bullets equally among your crew
And give you five so you don't feel left out
Like red the hammer
I'm nailing niggas in they spleens
Just to make walking again a sympathetic dream
Energetic schemes
Rap vandal and dismantle
Tackle MC's and wax you
Like your rap name was Candle
Grabbing a mic with no handles
Leaving you dusty
Like walking the desert in old sandals
If you weeded or drunk
Keep your heat in your trunk
We beat you to lumps
Swell you up with permanent mumps
We dangerous playa
Cuffin' my chews
Spittin the phlegm out
Getting at you whether you coming out
Or you been out
You never exempt
From this murderous attempt
I'm telling you pimp
Undeniably you are a loss
Invincible, why you trying to be a mind boss
If the Kon Artis say it then it's done
With or without a gun
Eat a track and spit out a drum
Bust one
Trust none
Playing the game of death
Take your last breath
Til your last name is left

Proof
Pah pow
Straight off the coral
Now the Dirtiest street vet from the Mile
Incest without the Texas six shooter
Body bullet polluter
Perverted intruder
Now who the fuck wanna buck with the disease
That's diss eased
I got a bitch named trigger
My main squeeze will make your brain freeze
Dirty D. is dope like cane trees

Eye Kyu
Remain eased
Maintain chill status with no pause
Hug slugs hit your cabbage
And turn your dome to cold slaw
My only thought of survival before my arrival
I'm jumpin' out on niggas like I'm 5 0
Smack 'em up like a pack o' trifle and fly hoes
Any opportunity to mangle I never pass up
Fuckin' your clique with broomsticks
Face down ass up
Dirty Dozen packin' the shit
To turn your chest red
With that dick in your mouth
Fuckin' everything you just said

Eminem
Yeah yeah bitch
Comin' to a block near you is Dirty Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with 30 husbands
When I was five I was already fuckin'
And playin' X Rated cassettes
With Teddy Ruxpin
I used to walk up and down the block cussin'
Locked in youth homes at 6 for glock bustin'
I grew up with knot ballers
Who got dollars
Shot collars with guns and rottweilers

Bizarre
By any means necessary I'm on a killing spree
It's the devil in me
Intoxicated with wild Hennessy
Beware life ain't fair and I don't care
Cher braids my hair
While her kids are in day care
Two blunts and I'm out for lunch
Your worse than I'm a sugar pie honey bunch
Diss Bizarre Kid, that ain't the answer
You're more uncomfortable than an anorexic cat
With fuckin' cancer

Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Here's your chance to advance

Smokin' LSD workin' on Lou Roff's new single
Who's the big guy that's quick like Sugar Ray
Fuck cow gods bitch
Bizarre might take you away
Give up the pussy cuz I know you a freak
Replacin' your hamster in a week
Cuz my crew's gots to eat
Eight reppin' anorexic girls
Who might eat up cock
Hold up Bizarre you're takin' that shit too far
But I can't stop cuz my will ain't there

Eminem
Twist 'em up
And dump that bitch in Lake Sinclair
Your mistakes ain't rare
Your rap style annoys
You rhyme like a bitch
Plus I can't stand your voice
Bitch you suck, you whack as fuck
Eat a dick, you need a brick upside your dome
We be the clique runnin' you down in carloads
Leavin' you smashed on tar roads
Flat line like bar codes

Eye Kyu
Put up your guard hoes
I'm blazing heat the way we speak
Not even Nike could cover these amazing feats
Burning rappers eternally
Internally and externally
For half steppin' like one legged fraternities
Quick draw McGraw
B.K.A. Eye kyu
Puttin' something inside you
Leavin' holes that I see right through
For anyone obstructing my view
My order of attack
These slugs to your chest
That'll blow your heart out your back
Makin' sure you get fed with a whole lotta led
Then throw you off of the Ambassador Bridge
And scream DROP DEAD

Proof
Largely I'm out to stack equations
Without a tax evasion
With mossy that's amazin'
All the same like black and asian
My pack evasion attack a stage and
Roll plush like a Cadillac
I wish your fleet would
Try to battle rap
Would make a man bleed
Like a cattle pack stampede
Frontin' cosign my hands bleed
Think they recognize like Sam Sneed
My drug ain't dispose ya
Another classic closure
The death master out to blast ya
My team run shit from the deep East Side
Down to Lasher
Past the   norm

Molest the children of the corn

And bone hood rats   'til they bleed on my floor mat
Nasty nigga, make YOU believe that I'm a classy nigga
But I'm far from that, average Joe that you know
Use people for shields at shootouts that I started, cold hearted
Runnin reckless, peep out your shorty 'til my neck twistin
An infectionist, poisonous bug we all drugged
Showed your daddy love or slugs; could have tortured him
Told me that he didn't wanna die, we still forced him
Thought his peeps had his back, when we brawled they fled
Now he layin dead with his chicked head like Dodi Fayed
Come to battle us with yo' heat and stabbed, nabbed and gagged
Jabbed and dragged and thrown inside of a bag
Your fans been had, bamboozled, run 'em up
But you loosing credibility the minute Dozen'll up

So FUCK that stank bitch with the saggy ass titties

Quote this   jot it down cause Kuniva wrote this
The wild animal rhyme culprit, ferocious
Close , nigga walkin behind you with a dosage
of terrifyin tales that be stompin small soldiers
The Grim Reaper dipped in all black like Folgers
Packin four heaters and carryin five holsters
Suppose if, I was to let you put up all your posters
Let everybody think you was the dopest HELL NAW
I'd rather strike you quicker then the cobra, box you up and sold ya
Take you underwater and hold you until it's over
I told you once you dumb dummies with a blunt
that be pullin off the dope fiend stunt of the month
Get yo' ass kicked quicker then punts, I'm sick of you punks
Cock it back now I'm upset, yo' nigga's next

Roll blunts, it's all tight, on a off night
I still smoke like exhaust pipes
and bust a universal flow to blow your wig back
Like niggaz with toupees, drivin a convertible
And furthermore I run the board; yo' shit is played
And the way you fell off you couldn't bounce back with a bungee cord

Bring your boys and, we can bring the noise and
YOU DON'T WANNA FUCK WITH DIRTY DOZEN

Bizarre
My crew is like amazed, put in fear like ex slaves
Who wanna step to this microphone and think that they BRAVE
Dozen always startin the fuckin beef
I don't give a fuck if you from Kansas, I'm still the fuckin  CHIEF 
Back the fuck up I'm releasin my dum dums
Tell your whore stop pagin me, 9 1 1
I'm a star that they call Bizarre
Smokin blunts with Mel Farr in my brand new car
The nigga  write rhyme wanna see me
If I was in Arizona, I'd still request iced tea
Bizarre don't give a shit about you
On top of the mountain   ain't nuttin your bitch ass crew can do
Sick MC that they call Peter
Treat your crew like an unexpected, meter reader
Talkin more shit than Howard Cosell
Butt fuckin Jezebels in nasty hotels

Proof
How you think yo' crew sound, compared to this
It's the team that yo' entire clique scared to diss
Demandin, attentions when the glock sound
Y'all niggaz to be murdered like Jeffery Dahmer's on lock down
I'm Brown like Bobby, pullin hoes like Whitney
Take your title kill your moms   so you won't forget me
Lips sealed; nigga, I might blow important plots
Whoever front is gettin done like Michael Jordan pops
Yo I'm number one translator, mic famed Dirty D
Y'all niggaz gettin hung like this was 1933
Got word of me now flee, cause you ain't got a chance
Death is three easy steps so now we gotta dance
So look away don't play with the style master
I love killin beef, so I kill a whole cow pasture
Lyrically I'm sick ill, everything but sober
Ny nickel plate, pack the disc tray
Jack and fool get fucked over   BRING IT

Eminem
Dirty Dozen is the clique so walk right over and lynch ya
Rip the ass right out ya pants like a Doberman Pinscher
Like the Cobra and Ninja, my intention's to injure
And prevent ya from enterin from an inch of my center
Or get your motherfuckin pants split at the creases
Fuckin you intellectually;
givin you mental sexually transmitted diseases
My duty is to keep a stranger barred
I guard my sector like a Saint Bernard, and this ain't the yard
Bringin the noise like a trigger happy gun slinger
Droppin your whole clique with one finger 'til none linger
Beware of my dogs attackin like a pack of Great Danes
Chargin like freight trains through the great plains

Brigade jump on a couple of punks
Nigga, we bad news
We bad news, nigga
To beef for real
If you step our way it's on
Anybody, everybody Oh shit
Come on
Brigade jump on a couple of punks
That's how we're moving it moving it moving it
To beef for real
If you step our way it's on
Anybody, everybody that's right
Come on

Kon Artis
We breaking every rule in the book
Illegal crooks that got your mind shook
Kon done with spells up
Poisonous cook
The Kon Artis
Make way for the hell raiser
Mysterious neighbor
Cuttin throats with broke Coke
Bottles and rusty razors
I ain't the one to save you in a crisis
I kick you while you're down
Snatch you up and ask you who's the nicest
Better say me
Or I'll put your next to some vice crips
And squeeze until they lifeless
I stayin confidence with my mind
About being good or evil
I'm deceitful
Lethal when I leave you
Dead inside your blood brother
When your hand for help reaches out
We just chuckle
Now where the fuck of how we is as individuals
We raise wrong
Politics and poverty got us head strong
You dead wrong
If you think you'll make it out with all your limbs
Grab your camera
So we can put this on film

Kuniva
Hey
Don't get cut into hundreds over some dumb shit
I advise you to run quick cuz we run this
Guns click on the reg reg
Put MCs on they death beads
Either that or leavin' 'em walking on peg legs
In various locations
I'll be wylin' out at places
I'm why they're running out
Of handicap parking spaces
Intense dreams
You want suspense It's endless
How I massacre crews
Leave you solo and friendless
Contact lens less then lifeless
The trifest MC
You never wanna fight with
Or rock a mic with
Carry a knife with
Da Brigade on the night shift
Pack this big dick that I use to fuck your wife with
You ain't the nicest
Derelicts with intelligence
Leaving your grill wide open like pelicans
Just wait
My words penetrate through your vertebrate
Til it snap your neck brace
And crack your chest plate

Kon Artis
You studies wanna job like assets
Rough is ready to start teaching niggas
In ass whippin' classes
Breaking glasses
Damage crews by the masses
Shit talking like Cassius
Get in your E Class and dash bitch
Kon Artis
The only man that can expand the cervix
With the tip of my bone
Get in your girl and keep fucking
Until she starts screaming Leave me alone
Walking predacone
Looking for weak grade to set it on
From dusk til dawn I bomb
Went through hell and remain calm
The devils to stir us to fight me
Just to see what type of shit that I was on
Those bastards is why they got burnt
And turned into crisp XXXXX
With lyrics hotter than lava comes
It's urgent
That she splurge with
Before I merge with
Kuniva will make ya nerves emerge and split
Heard me bitch
You weren't worthy with the mic
Is why I snatch it
And people think and praise with words that I like
With things that I say on you
You need someone to spar with
Put you in the back of my trunk
Get in my car trick
Running with nothing but thugs
With the fug
We more dangerous than L.A. cops with big clubs
Who's arresting you when you're drunk
You sick munk
Spitting up bills scriptures and gumps
Till you punks get the picture
Get it
If rap was a whore you couldn't hit it
I make it my business
Twenty four seven to try and stick it

Kuniva
Gotta get it
I gotta give it to you non stop
Bombs drop lyrical warfare we onslaught
Dead bodies rot
We making your body rock
Licking them off like lollipops
That the shotty pop
Kuniva snatch rolex chains, watches and anklets
Dissin' the stank bitch
Packing heaters to make you thank quick
Now ain't this
Something you don't want a piece of
Don't worry about waiting these ones
Chillin' with me buds

Bitch
Yeah...

1 
Shit can happen 8X

Kon Artis
Yo, yo, huh, yo, yo, yo
That's right motherfuckers we back
Same slangin, orangatangin, wildin out on hoodrats
They say I act like I'm too famous to say hi
And tell 'em what my name is but really I'm still nameless...
You niggaz don't get it yet, do you
Dealin out platinum or flop I still put it through you
Wit a luger that'll spit fire
And hit higher than a pitch by a bitch like Mariah
You think for one second since we got a deal
that we won't deal wit you in front of St. Andrew's still
You gay rappers better learn that
I won't stop until I see 'em turn back
If you don't slow that roll you got
You gon see these Runyan Ave. niggaz that really need some Prozac
Fo' sho' that, ask the others
Brigade'll lay you down next to your mother's mother's grandmother

Kuniva
You know I'm feelin real rowdy tonight
Ready to fight and half the niggaz I give dap to I don't even like
The same cat who never gave a damn about your name
I gives a fuck about it like the next L.A. Clippers' game bitch
I kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom punk
You and your madame, it's really unexplainable how I have 'em
Who call theyself screamin about a challenge what
Nigga we got a gift while you barely makin it off mere talent
My skills are deeply embedded even your hoe said it uh huh
She was knock kneed I fucked her now she's bow legged
In the middle of rappin I drop the mic what
And have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrappin bitch
Kuniv' and Kon Artis my nigga we get it crackin
While the paramedics pick you up we on the side laughin

Kon Artis
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen to him and yo' ass
You can be touched don't think you can't

Swifty McVay
The feds can't hold me, I hold feds
I was born with a dark ass cloud over my head
Rainin acid, you can't refrain from gettin yo' ass kicked
Cause you talk too much   you asked for it
I'm on some massive shit, everybody ignore me
They wouldn't fuck with me if I was performin at an orgy
These niggaz get confronted whattup now then they change stories
I cut you and they thinkin everything's hunky dory
I even have you pourin me the gasoline for me
Pullin up slowly, cocktailin your homie CRASH
You met a lot of niggaz but you wouldn't wanna know me f'real
Yo' ass might not even make it home wit your Roley
Don't even try, in your system like e. coli
Tryin to beef with me, nigga please yo' people die
I'm so wicked that my mama gave birth illegally
I survived the abortion immediately, SURPRISE AAAAAH

Eminem
Picture me sittin in a jail cell rottin shit
Or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns
Cocked, ready to dump slugs heavy as shotputs
One man army, guns can't harm me
Young and ornery, worse than my Uncle Ronnie
Ever since I got my first gun pulled on me
I can't stop airin out my dirty laundry
Middle fingers flipped and censorship
Your friends just flipped over the swift penmanship
Ever since I spit some shit on Infinite
I been givin it, a hundred and ten percent
Cause when I'm bent   most of my energy's spent on enemies
Eighty percent of what I invent is Hennessey
Twenty percent is from being hungry as sin
Ten's because I love being under your skin
Yeah shit can happen, so stick to rappin
Quit the yappin or I'ma lift the mac and
That can lead to another mishap happenin
Skip the crap get the can of whoop ass crackin

Eminem
It can and it will nigga, nigga
Fuck around with Amityville and you DIE
Insanity spills from the mentality of twelve motherfuckers
in six different bodies with their personalities split
Fuckin you up with hit after hit
Stickin you up with clip after clip
Makin you suck dick after dick
Dirty motherfuckin dozen
The Kon Artis, motherfuckin Peter S. Bizarre
Swifty McVay, the Kuniva, Dirty father fuckin Harry
Puttin you down in a cemetery, you get buried
All you of you motherfuckers suck our motherfuckin cocks
We are not playin, we are not playin
We are not bullshittin, this is not a motherfuckin joke

Bizarre Yeah, welcome to Amityville
Swifty  Detroit, nigga
Bizarre The reason why rappers gotta pack pistols

Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this do
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

Ain't goin nowhere without my gun
I walk the streets I pack my gun
I go to sleep I got my gun
Can't go nowhere without my gun

Swifty McVay
Nigga, we violently active   so fuck with us
See I'm backwards   I slap niggas and punch bitches
Just for askin, they must've been wantin to meet the Lord
When my parents talked to me, they got mean mugged and ignored
They were snoopin through my closet, seen drugs on the floor
Shells from the forty four scattered over they porch
Bustin pistols in your windows with intentions to destroy you
Tryin to break your neck to conversate  Bitch, I'll do it for you
Catch me laughin at your funeral when they lower you
You and yo' ho, you gots to go, bitches died slow and horrible
There's no tomorrow fo'   any nigga we'll shower you
We young strapped & powerful BITCH and I ain't gotta lie to you

Proof
Stepped in the door, wavin the fo' fo'
Blazin at po po, escapin and lay low
They call my tongue ya yo, but I spit fire
I lit five inside a fuckin dickrider
The clip slider, love to blast a Mag
You a FAG, you love bein ass to ass
Grab a gun by the nose with the butt to gat spank ya
Never say that I'm a gangsta now THAT'S gangsta
Y'all niggaz sound like Jigga but act like 'Pac
Yo my trigger got the flu and this gat might cough
It ain't nuttin to tell, empty shells for the witness
I'm the hot nigga that's gon' put hell outta business
It won't be the same since we touchin the game
Make the hardest nigga in your crew, tuck in his chain
Y'all think this shit's a game and I'm bluffin for fame
I'll squeeze off this tech until nothin remains

Kuniva
The only time that I'm at peace/piece is when I'm close to one
cause I don't know what's waitin for me when my vocals are done
Tote the gun, it's my way of life and it works
These cowardly niggaz'll put yo' fuckin life in the dirt
Cause it was wrong how they left my dog, he was priceless
Alone in the streets, bleedin, starin, layin lifeless
That's why I'm heated, you never know who starts creepin uh huh
Wakin you up with AK's while you lie sleepin
I'd rather pack the heat and not need it;
rather than need one and not have it, I married this Glock matic

Kon Artis
You know the sound
when I'm spinnin round spittin these rounds from fo' pounds
While the whole crowd screamin as loud from they mouths
Nothing is parallel to making you carousel
Arial sommersault like ferris wheels to a pair of shells
Denaun carry the nine where I go
Bullets whistle and hit you while I'm shootin at five oh
Some semi automatic for static's the motto

Bizarre
This nine'll turn a softy to a hard rock
It'll make Jehovah's Witnesses, think before they knock Sorry, sorry
It'll make your grandmother come out of a purse
it'll make Limp Bizkit, get rid of Fred Durst Ha ha
It'll make Holyfield start fightin
it'll make Ma$e say Fuck church, and go back to writin
It'll make Shyne say he sound like Biggie Smalls
it'll make R. Kelly   give respect to Aaron Hall
It'll make Christopher Reeves start walkin
it'll make a dog with no voice, suddenly start barkin
It'll make a nun turn to a filthy slut
it'll make the hardest pitbull, turn to a fuckin mutt
It'll make a Muslim dye his hair blonde
It'll make the redneck start to read the Holy Qu'ran
It'll make Ike stop beatin Tina
it'll make Slim Shady   fall back in love with Christina
Christina Aguilera... HA HA HA HA

Swifty

Then treat me like a dirty slave dirty slave, dirty slave
And beat me like I won't behave   I just wanna get freaky baby

Swifty McVay
Huh, I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up wit you hoes
You don't know me, see I ain't gotta front or play the role
I'm an O.G., I know when you bein phony
See you probably bonin them officers just to pull up on me
That's why sixty percent of women is lonely
They get in my mix only, then try to creep slowly because they nosy
I ain't listen to what, my momma told me

Then he fuck 'em and pass 'em to the homies take her

Kuniva
Yo I know I'm dogmatic, but yo' pussy walls done had it that's right
It's evident that you've been fuckin like a jackrabbit
But I stay focused, so I acted like I didn't notice mm hmm
And fucked her with no baby lotion and bust in the soapdish
Hoe you can quote this   your breath is smellin like
you done sucked a senior citizen's old dick in goat spit god damn
You gon' get choked quick, talkin all that hoe shit
All aggressive askin for a slow kiss, no bitch the fuck outta here
You like freakin, see you every night creepin
Suckin off the nice deacons, slut you made his wife leave him cunt
So keep slurpin I'll be down to the fullest
But forget it bitch, yo' nipples look like AK bullets

Kon Artis
Yo   I'm tearin down whatever you built, your marriage is through
cause I answered your wife's door naked wrapped in a quilt
Hoes say, Kon Artis got a dick so big
Man I can persuade any bitch to have eight of my kids, shit
Beeitch, I should be locked up for havin honies legs cocked up
in the back of my pops truck
I'm not fucked up, I just got a fetish for shootin
Cum in coochie to the pussy is pootin it back out
I sixty nined this one bitch and she bled in my mouth shit
Kicked her out, cleaned the couch out, and beat up my crouch
I don't gotta creep in hotels, I cheat at my house
See I'm a dog, I don't need to keep a secret hideout nahh

Bizarre
Your age and where you from   it's just not important nahh
You look like one of my mistresses
On welfare, ten kids like the rest of my bitches
Dreams of fuckin a handicapped bitch
Suck my dick while your teeth start to grit whore
And a slave, that's how I want you to treat me
I ain't into S&M, but I love when you beat me ahhh
I told you I was a horny ass freak
While I'm beatin my meat, your daughter actin like she asleep
Yeah right My love is like thunder and lightning
After it's over, I'm lookin like I got my ass kicked by Tyson

Bizarre
Freaky baby, he he
I wanna get freaky with you
D 12.. in your area
And remember, if you lookin for Bizarre
Dial 1 900 BEAT ME

Eminem
It's shit like this I kick to these rich white kids
Who just might see how fucked up this sick life is
Whoops I did it again didn't I my shit's harder
to figure out than what Britney's tit size is oooh
I probably pissed you off again didn't I bitch so what
You know how many shits I give I wish I did
So I can quit givin these twisted little kids ideas
This just in, Britney just dissed Justin
She just fucked Ben, got tit fucked and dick sucked him
If Affleck can get his ass licked, how come I can't, shit
God damn bitch, I'm rich, I can't understand this
Are those pictures I made of us together on the internet
as close as I'm ever gonna get to hittin it from the back
And shit, when it comes to that, I hit harder from the back
than Everlast, when he's pluggin Lethal in his fuckin ass
Just give me one more chance, Britney hit me one more time
Let me know what's on your mind, Whitney give me one more line
to sniff, you fuckers know what time it is
Fuck your jewelery my record's almost diamond, BEEOTCH

What's goin on in the world today
People fightin, feudin, lootin, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre it ain't nuttin but music

Bizarre
Eminem doesn't like N'Sync, well I do
So fuck him, and the Backstreet Boys too
Whatever happened to the cast of Different Strokes
Gary's broke, Todd's snortin coke, and Dana overdosed
Awww I got two little boys with me
Michael Jackson sent two helicopters to get me hee heee
I'm up early wit my hair curly
Me and Mr. Furly, fuckin Laverne and Shirley

Kuniva
A lot of rappers are livin in la la land
That's why I let my dogs out on the Baha Men
As bad as a life I had, I'm not mad
I don't need to be a jackass to beat up my dad
My whole family's country, my grandmother's old fashioned
And she keeps askin me why I rap wit a honky
But grannie I'm a flunky I could be a junkie
I could be hangin with the hoochies out at the club scene

Kon Artis
So all the independent women in the house HOUSE
Show us your tits and shut your motherfuckin mouth WHAT

Proof

Got George Michael's, Tevin Campbell's

Swifty McVay
Huh, your mom and dad probably mad at us for what
We done turned their kids into little body snatchers
Aint like where I'm from, we don't bite our tongue
Are you sure you want niggaz 21 to carry guns
It's sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme
Where you work you ain't gettin paid for that overtime
It's only music, media know it but they blind
I aint in y'all light, so stay the hell up outta mine
Y'all the reason why Princess Diana ended up dyin
If you people get offended I don't care stop cryin
Tryin to get us to leave cause what we say just ain't clean uh uh
But holdin back on what I say just ain't me

Kon Artis
Now what's these parents so mad for Your music is bad for 'em
For teenage kids that drink more than Ted Danson in Cheers
Carson drink beers, we all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch
SHUT UP Broke or rich, I still do the same old shit
I don't jump in front of a camera and change no shit
So when they ask me about my sarcasticness
I just slap 'em, turn around and ask 'em this

Eminem
I'm the devil   if ever there was such a thing
The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing
I'm a dog   fuck lambs, I'm silencin 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor
Each thought's completely warped
I'm like a walkin, talkin, ouija board
Speakin in tongues, I've never spoke this speech before
.. Hhem delle la, ennich me noughh mi niche mick norr ..
Have you ever experienced spirits in lyrics when you hear 'em
'til you scared to stare in into any mirrors when you near 'em
Well if so, get ready for some shit yo
Is this some kind of sick joke Shit no, motherfuckin schitzo
So disturbed, he just goes so berzerk he tiptoes
Fist first with scissors to slit throats of just hoes
Just goes to shizzow you dizzon't, fizzuck with
so someone this disturbed, sa sippin on si zzurp
So   lock your doors, drop to the floors
Get your shotguns drawn   here comes another Clockwork Orange
Look at Bizarre; you really think he's right in his mind
What the fuck you think's goin through it when he's writin his rhyme

You bout to   journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his silent screams
You bout to   journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his violent screams

Bizarre
It's Friday night, I'm at a rave again
Pickin up transvestites on my Harley Davidson hey hop on
My girlfriend's a crackhead whore
She'll come to your door, suck your dick on the floor
and take your bottles to the store nigga I'm takin these
Have you ever seen a bitch get beat because she won't cheat
Run the street and suck another nigga's meat
My son's sixteen years old with nowhere to stay dad it's me
I told him he wasn't mine, slammed the door in his face
And I ain't got no food, my job I've been cheated
My girlfriend had a miscarriage I'm sorry I had to eat it ohh
My dick is burnin, it ain't cause of disease
Because I'm jackin off with gasoline mixed with antifreeze AHH
I'm livin in Waco Texas, me and my girl
Fuck David Koresh, I'm startin my own world
It's called Bizarre Cemetary, it's scary
Eatin a virgin's cherry, they're all gonna laugh at you Carey

Kon Artis
I was born feet first, smoke 40's and drink weed
The Lord rehearsed my birth, I'm the worst breed
A nigga you ever set sight on, my right arm's
got more power than Fiber ICON, dragon's python so
Journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Light yo' ass like a liquid nitro gas spiller
Psycho slash Michael Myers, Michael Jack's Thriller
Rifle slash knife, faggot basher, cop killer
As a yung'un, I was beat where I was livin aight
Crossdressed just to get thrown in the women's prison
You're not gay I guess I was just stressed to be a hoodlum
Being pressed caused the stress that caused the Ritalin
Pressed stressed and Ritalin caused the cop's feelings
to be hurt after they seen what I did to those children
I'm vulgaric, you Bo Derek; I throw you face flat off the terrace
so you can have somethin to stare at

Then see your mother comin home with different niggaz every night
And then you run into the one you don't like; so get the FUCK lost
D 12 That's how step dads get fucked up

D 12 This is how it happens to you
D 12 That's how people get fucked up
D 12 This is how it happens to you
D 12 That's how people get fucked up
D 12 This is how it happens to you
D 12 That's how people get fucked up
D 12 This is how it happens to you
D 12 That's how people get fucked up

Eminem
Ugh.. yo yo yo, yo

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin
But nothin compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Eminem
Yo, yo
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit oops
Aww shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids AHH
These 'shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losin weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce me
Not weed, I meant coke, dumb ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D 12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passin out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out
Come on

Kon Artis and Kuniva
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Heh, hey Von you see me steppin on these leprechauns
It gotta be acid cause the X is gone
Ya I took them all dawg with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on
Yo stop actin stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new shit EWW
Yeah I think I did too much    This substance equals cups
Red pills, blue pills, and green    Big pills that's ill, mescaline

Eminem
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other

Proof
Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was  Incredible  and killed the  Hulk 
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm, old and gray look for dope to smoke
No okey doke, I'm packin my nose with coke
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I gotta strangle a.. You're crazy

Swifty McVay
I pop fo' E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin mine
Yeah, you got any shrooms Does Bizarre smoke crack
We can't get jobs cause our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggaz think I rap
We do it just to get your company hijacked
And if you like smack uh huh then I might too
Swift, chill I just wanna get high like you ewww
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue uh huh
Speed, 'shrooms, down the valiums uh huh
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin back soon

Bizarre
I'm at rave lookin like a slave, high off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Pussy poppin, acid droppin, dope headed guy
Heroin mescaline, pencilnecks, wanna try
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre, actin ill
Drugs kill Yeah right   Bitch, I'm for real
Shut your mouth you dirty slut, you know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt; let Bizarre nut

Eminem
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other

This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know   that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
and drastic movement of people actin stupid

Kon Artis
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smellin like Boone's Farm
Hidin under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own moms
Connivin Kon, Artis with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach screamin, Let's get it on
A lush that love to drink, drunk drivin a tank
Rollin over a bank, cops see me and faint
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slittin your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street, 'til it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music

Bizarre
You know why my hands are so numb No
Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't cum oh
Smacked this whore for talkin crap bitch
So what if she's handicapped, the bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap
I fuckin hate you; I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you hell yeah
Satan done got me on this song
Eatin a hot dog readin the Holy Qu'ran, while I'm on the john
Tired of wearin this yellow thong
Take it back Sisqo, you know where it belongs thong th thong thong
Now here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms
Fuck your love songs

Proof
Just bring who you gon' bring on, who you gon' swing on
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to king dom come
Show you machine gun funk
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaw
Have you runnin out this fuckin club in your drawers
We lovin the broads, there's nothin to applaud
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in The Source
It's fight music

Swifty McVay
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back right in front of the priest sayin, You hear that
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talkin
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers and made 'em drop his coffin
It's fight music

Kuniva
These beads I'm swingin is stingin 'em
See all these niggaz  When I step in the club, I'm bringin 'em
If any nigga lookin too hard, we Rodney King'n 'em
Malice green to them and gasolinin 'em with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at 'em or spit it at 'em
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him
Blast while you right hookin, right when your wife's lookin
Fuck fight music, bitch this is losin your life music

Eminem
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
Then spit it back in the faces of you racists
and hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberace's, Versace's, and you nazis
Watch me, cause you thinkin you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna JUDGE me cause you're NOT me
You'll never STOP me, I'm TOP speed as you POP me
I came to save these new generations of babies
from parents who failed to raise 'em cause they're lazy
to grow to praise me I'm makin 'em go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sic'd on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called..

It's fight music

I'm an instigator   nigga can't you see
I'm an instigator   ain't nobody worse than me
I'm an instigator   I'll be the first to beef
first to squeeze, take heed to the words I speak
I'm an instigator   nigga can't you see
I'm an instigator   ain't nobody worse than me
I'm an instigator   I'll be the first to beef
first to squeeze, 'til it hurts to breathe, fuck with me

Kuniva
I love gettin shit started
I instigate a peace talk into a beef talk until police need chalk
to chalk you up, have bitches walkin up
Smackin you in your face, screamin that you talk too much
Tell women you said you fucked 'em
Tell the hardest nigga you said you snuck him
Ran his pockets and stuck him
'Til they gather in front of your crib, guns and long clips
Laughin when they shoot at you over the wrong shit
I lock down your block with lies that's so believable
you'll run and grab your shotguns, glocks and nines whattup
Walkin blind, excite fights until they erupt do it
Instigate my own death cause killin you ain't enough

Swifty McVay
I don't give a fuck if we beefin or not, I'll squeeze first
I'ma heat up yo' spot, I'm a nigga that breathe dirt
On these streets every day, snatchin niggaz yea
How you bitches needin work, you can get it from McVay
I'm dispiteful, I tie a hoe a maniacal foul animal
liable to leave you strapped with yo' bible fo' real
I'm psycho, my bullets won't fly by you
Ain't gotta wait 'til night to snipe if I don't like you
You gettin hit in broad daylight with a white rifle
In front of yo' window I'm lookin right through
I love when I see a nigga get stuck..

Kon Artis
I'm an instigator   drama tends to follow me
I know, I probably owe all of my friends apologies
Lie to every bitch just to get her to swallow me
Get a lobotomy nigga this one's to my arteries
Guns are a part of me I pack more than pottery
I oughta be jailed for depicted mockery
Egg on fights to plot on the niggaz that shot at me
I don't twist the truth I just make it gothic see
I'm nothin but a liar with a big ass mouth
Dick and fists big enough to knock your bitch ass out
Got no reason to tell you the truth
But to be honest with you I rap with him but I don't like Proof

Proof
Nigga fuck you, me and Swift got plans to jump you
Type of nigga to shake your hand and stomp you
I'm an instigator   convince a tenth grader
to run up inside his classroom and leave the kids..
Bitch wait up, this is the season
for squeezin off triggers on niggaz for no reason
Either jump or quit runnin your mouth
Pull a gun out, but I use it 'til the bullets run out

Swifty McVay
I throw a brick at your crib, have you standin on the porch
screamin, Look what you did I ain't feelin no remorse
Nigga just pick up the kids, and Swift got first dibs
with these cherry hot slugs that'll barbecue your ribs
I'm preparin deathbeds, quick to bust lead
while I'm starin at the Feds, tearin off they legs
Once you drop dead they'll be swearin it's a plague
I'm sicker than a coke rastafarian with dreads
You get shanked if you move, ditched with no clues
Don't put shit on yo' tape but yo' skits and interludes
And once I finish you they wouldn't put it in the news
I'm nuts so you hoes ain't got the GUTS to interview

Whattup
I gotta tell you motherfuckers the truth
This is straight G shit
And all you can do is respect it

Swifty McVay
Well I'ma state my name, Swift McVay
None of y'all niggaz got shit to say
Rhymes keep comin off like a toupee
Plus I'm big headed runnin things my way
A selfish man, the back of the hand
Be slappin the hell out of hoes because I can
Prostitute, I want my loot
And I don't give a fuck about your broke ass man and
Y'all givin niggaz what they needin
'til bitches understand I'm mean and
Swift McVay is, blowin up
Courvosier 'til I'm throwin up
Wanna playa hate me, bitch so what
What's yo' function Where's yo' bucks
All you wanna do is wanna stick him up
You wanna rob me but I got too much hah
D 12, naturally lifted
You niggaz better duck when I cock the biscuit
You fuck wit me, I fuck wit you
Your entourage, nigga fuck them too
I got grenades
What the hell your little twenty two gon' do
Y'all ain't gon' shoot
Y'all major soft
Cops gettin mad cause I paid 'em off, made 'em cough
blood and shit
That's what the hell you motherfuckers get, we runs this bitch
So hey, you ain't gotta be scared to fuck
If you want head, then prepare to suck do it
Even if the nigga don't care to nut
For every stroke, it's a hundred bucks
Respect the game, you just a slut
So open your legs up and get my duck

You just a .. hoe

Dirty ass .. hoe
I'm yo' pimp, you my bitch

Go get my .. dough
Go bring me my .. dough
Dirty ass .. hoe

Proof
I don't spit game, no longer than my name
Then when my chain hang, my nuts do the same
Don't pay pussy, pussy pay me
Bitch, slut, whore or lady yup
And knowin the fact, I was born to mack
That's why I got a hoe in the back, blowin my sac
Got good game, that's a hood thang
What'd you brang, loot or poo tang
Let 'em all bang, run that cheese
Tell that trick nigga come back please
Rob a L7, that's a square
You a bottom hoe, you got to know
Off you I plan to make a lot of dough
So suck fast bitch, and swallow slow

Kon Artis
I don't pay for ass, you pump my gas
You get slapped when we're short of cash
I get whiplash when I hit the gas
And I holla out the window of the hatch
Where's my scratch  Bitch, that's, it
Suck it stroke it make me rich
As a token of my appreciation it's
another client for you to hit
I don't give a fuck if you gotta go home to the kids
You shoulda picked another occupation trick
Now you're stuck with me, fuck with me
and I'ma slap you up in this truck
You must be out your mind or somethin
Cryin and whinin like you tired or somethin
Go suck some head until it aches for Bufferin
You don't work  You make nothin
I'm just another case of a lazy husband

Kuniva
I want the paper stack
Buy you an outfit, then take it back
When you page me BITCH I never page you back
You only act a certain way that I make you act whattup
Hoes recognize, and niggaz do too
Cause they realize that niggaz do shoot
Don't like a chick that act too cute
Bitch hold my gat down when I shoot hoops oh yeah
And don't be askin me, all kind of questions
All harassin me, callin stressin
Or I may have to release some aggression
Beat you to death and teach you a lesson
Lookin for handouts like you my damn spouse
Pull your pants down and fuck my mans now
Shut your damn mouth or get in the damn house
Off with the damn blouse and suck on my damn crotch

Bizarre
Sell that pussy
Sell that pussy bitch
Get out there and switch and go make Bizarre rich
You gotta itch, you fuckin dirty bitch
Now get on the corner, and start suckin some dicks
Niggaz want pussy, and I need cash
So mom, get out there and start sellin yo' dirty ass
Bizarre quick to hit 'em, and then stick 'em
Fuck it; I'll let you hit one of my victims
Somebody help I'm on 7 Mile and ..
Shut up bitch, you talk too much
Now you about to get fucked in your dirty butt
You never seen a pimp like me, out here whorin
Shut your fuckin mouth and you'll be out by the mornin
Cause I'm the dirties pimp, you ever heard of
Give me my five thousand, and take this cheeseburger bitch
Go suck dick at a bachelor party
So what if you on your period, blood never hurt nobody

Eminem w/ Dina Rae

Eminem
Yo yo yo yo
Schizophrenia, how many of ya got it
How many motherfuckers can say they psychotic
How many motherfuckers can say they brain dry rotted from pot
You got it like I got it or not
If you did, you would know just what I'm talkin bout
When your tongue's rottin out from cotton mouth
When you end up becomin so dependent on weed
that you end up spendin a G in the vendin machine
You got the munchies, look at you, junk food junkie
Potato chips and lunch meat, up in the front seat
Sometimes you can get so paranoid from ganja
that's it gotcha thinkin the whole world is watchin ya
Or maybe you don't smoke, maybe you just roll
But whatever your drug's yo, go for the gusto
Just don't, come fuck with me when I'm doin my drugs
You see me in the club don't come fuckin my high up and

Blow, my, buzz
You want to want to just don't blow, my, buzz

Bitches I'm catchin, blunts I'm matchin
Don't call me Bizarre, I'm the Reverand Jesse Jackson

Swifty McVay
Who the fuck is this guy, why the hell you in my presence
It'd be cool if you was askin me some reasonable questions
But you on some bullshit nigga, this yo' last beer f'real
Get the fuck off my dick and tell yo' bitch to bring here ass here
I kick a hoe out without givin her cabfare
And leave her barefooted just for naggin in my damn ear
When I'm out eatin, you fags'll interfere
They don't go until I let 'em know a mag' is sittin here
I get drunk and I smoke weed, whatcho' ass wanna hear
I didn't answer you clear, I met Manson this year okay
You want some yea  I'll front yo' ass a play

Because you niggaz tryin to

Kon Well at least somebody in this bar is, this big bitch did

Go kill yourself
Kon Fuck you
Kun Well stop blowin my buzz

Proof
I'm at the front of the bar by the lounge in the back

And we gonna go to the phone lines right now

Caller my ass  You know who this is
Look I'm mad as hell
First you got Eminem, this nigga say he gon' get me on his album
No show I didn't get on it
Then he signed these niggaz D 12, these lil' punk ass niggaz
Then all of a sudden I heard he signed a new motherfucker named

Obie Trice
Obie Trice, first I took the underground over
The Well Known Asshole brought y'all horror
Then the industry saw interest in me
Now I'm Shady Records like Marshall Mathers LP
Mr. Trice, the name has occured
in your conversation, but the face is a blur
And if you never spoke my name, nigga you heard
Got word, from that mega bitch that stay bootleggin
Underground since the Fu Schnickens
Or underground since Chi Ali was fuckin with them stupid bitches
Different species AHHH
Shittin on you punk motherfuckers
with a Dirty Dozen type of feces

Eminem
I make music to make you sick of fake music
Hate music like devil worshippin Satan music
So say your prayers, your Hail Mary's and Jesuses
Take two sticks, tape 'em together and make a crucifix
Try to stop it but you cain't do it ha ha
A whole generation of kids blowin out their fuckin brains to this
Kurt Cobain music   students converted to 'caine users
as soon as they heard it went out and murdered and maimed to it
What's your name

Swifty McVay
Judas
Got my nine with six sharpshooters, now let's do this
I got niggaz that shoots to static   you don't understand
how I'm all up in you niggaz TV's like Carole Anne
I'm a poltergeist, lyrically I'm supposed to strike
Try to snatch this mic, you get cracked with Molson Ice
Swifty get your own woman I want his wife
I'm the type to go to gamblin parties with trick dice
I rob casinos, slugs, eat those
You'd think it was the devil feedin you jalapenos
Now you out of the scene hoes shot at your clean clothes
My fo' fo', prone to make you niggaz breathe wrong

It's Devils Night da da dah, da da da da dah
It's Devils Night da da dah, da da da da dah duh da
Cause I came back to rule this time
It's Devils Night   cause I came back to take what's mine
Yes it's Devils Night da da dah, da da da da dah
It's Devils Night da da dah, da da da da dah duh da
Cause I came back to rule this time
It's Devils Night   cause I came back to take what's mine

Kon Artis
It's like I'm on the john, tryin to shit and get no response
Constipated bitch, tell these pigs to back off
The mind of rapist, Denaun never changes
Beat up strangers without a reason, I'm a anus
Walk the street in a Beat It jacket with a glove to match it
Drop the hatchet I put my head on opposite and step backwards
Walkin zombied it's ornery
Pullin armed robberies on politicians without a sense of camraderie

Kuniva
Yo, I can concoct the nine slot, plus I run with the best
Hop on a motorcycle, bustin wheelies over your chest
Bystanders standin by, thinkin oh what a mess
Blast through every hickie that them bitches put on your neck
What the fuck do you expect, when the slugs are dealt
And make you feel every ounce of pain that Bugz done felt
A deranged team, smokin ganja greens
This car beam'll make your fuckin head shake like tambourines
I pledge allegiance to the streets of the D
And if you think you out cold, catch a piece of this heat
From her barettes to her cheeks to her cute little feet

Bizarre
STOP TAKIN DRUGS  I'm tryin
My little boy is dyin, he losin too much iron
And if I die, it won't be because I got shot
It'll be because I tied my arm in a sock and smoked rock
Takin drugs is cool, that's why I buy 'em
Shoot 'em up my ass, let your little brother try 'em
Ten years is what I'm facin
Police breakin in my house, Lil' Bow Wow in the basement
Jermaine A rapist that'll bust in your mouth
I'll probably be in jail 'fore this fuckin album comes out
I'm eighteen years old, still shit in the bed
Beaten 'til I'm red, fed nothin but water and bread
It's me again, fuckin dirty jinn
So what if it burns, bitch when I stick it in
No medication, I'm out of perkasets
I lost my weed, plus my fuckin diaper's wet

Eminem
It's Devils Night

I don't wanna go to school.. I don't need no education
I don't wanna be like you.. I don't wanna save the nation daddy no
I just wanna live my life.. everyday a celebration
One day I'ma leave this world.. I'm waitin for the revelation

Bizarre
I wanna kill myself  I'm still debatin
In front of a baptist church, masturbatin
Prayin to Satan   think I'm crazy cause I smoke crack
Live on B with the mac in a two family flat fuck it
Tired of gettin hit in the face with a broom
My moms on her period, my dad's in my room Daddy no
I got ten rocks and I need to get out
I sold them in five minutes, at my own damn house Moms smoke crack
My poor grandmother, God bless her soul
The bitch got AIDS aww she just waitin to die of a cold hahaha
There's three things that keep me from bein a Nazi
I'm black, a fag, and my dad's Liberace

Kon Artis
No matter how bad the beatin, I went to school cheatin
My dad whooped my ass at a PTA meetin
Stick with school I had to have nuts just to do it
Got bored and became truant
When I had the gall to go I just couldn't do it
I was lured into corners by the peer pressure shit
How would you feel if you was held by the tip of a barrel
Gettin threatened to get your skin ripped to bone marrow
Bet suburban kids never got rushed for their apparel
like me, outcast, last in class
First to leave, when the teacher called on me
Best believe I had somethin up my sleeve

Eminem
I've been praised and labelled as crazed
My mother was unable to raise me, full of crazy rage
An angry teenager, nothin can change me back
Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac
I was boostin, so influenced by music I used it
as an excuse to do shit, ooh I was stupid
No one can tell me nothin hip hop overwhelmed me
to the point where it had me in a whole 'nother realm
It was like isolatin myself was healthy
It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy
Compelled me to excel when school it failed me
Expelled me and when the principal would tell me
I was nothin, and I wouldn't amount to shit
I made my first million and counted it
Now look at, a fuckin drop out that quits
Stupid as shit, rich as fuck, and proud of it
That's why

Swifty McVay
I was raised with a rifle and mask
Steadily beatin my psychiatrist ass just for askin about my past
bitch I was never on that punk shit; fuckin around
can get yo' belove abducted, smothered in blood quick
You couldn't pay Swift to give a fuck
Was crazy like my father, it musta been poison in that nigga's nut
Far as probation, fuck peein in cups
I violate at any time, let 'em see the blunt
I grew up steadily masturbatin inside of cells
Young as hell, havin conversations with myself
You could tell I wasn't lenient, a disobedient
Lynched and slapped teachers, bitch I'm not readin it
You don't know what dawgs go through, a little nigga
Sippin liquor with my old dude, what the fuck you gon' do
I'm quick to curse you, I told my mother that I'ma hurt you
if you ever again mention a curfew

Kuniva
Look, my family ignored me and I don't like that
They don't even listen when I tell them I'll be right back
Yeah whatever This nice beautiful house ma, it don't mean shit
Cause you know daddy's a drunk and he don't clean shit
And yesterday he hit me like a grown fuckin man
I couldn't stand up to him, I just ducked and ran
I'm sick of this, I wish on Christmas
that I can get a loaded four fifth and put a fuckin end to this
Fuck it I got no friends and I can't get a bitch
Only thing I have is dirty magazines and sticky fingertips
Nothin to smile about, I'm about to lose my mind
Got me an automatic nine, now I'm ballin out

Proof
Wait 'til school's over, pu pil are people to shoot through
Kids goin cuckoo, with a two two
Since my friend is this new dude, in this high school
Losin his noodle learn that people don't like you
The football jocks is, spittin on him
Popular kids in school is now pickin on him
Burn out youngsta niggaz now hittin on him
And his teacher in his english class keep flippin on him
And now he's grounded with no allowances
for drinkin forty ounces, cause he was caught by his counselors
And why the fuck I gotta ride the bench coach
Already got expelled for wearin a trenchcoat
Told me to keep silent, stop battin my eyelids
It's apparent that my parents weren't parents at all
That's why I blew out my brains and murdered you all

Eminem
Hey yo dawg
I got some shit on my motherfuckin chest that
I need to get off cause, if I don't
I'ma fuckin explode, or somethin
Now look   this is a story about
some little fuckin girls that I know
It goes like this..

It's so easy for me to make enemies any more it's sickening
People are lookin for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that, I don't wanna be in   shit
I never had no beef with your corny son of a bitches
But now the shit is broke and you can't do nothin to fix it
So I'm tellin you right now   motherFUCK a Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real, B Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin;
see he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpackin cypherin name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin and
I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentionin me
That little fuckin weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
Talkin bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me
Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song
Talkin bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong
What's wrong You scared, and Fred, you said you was dissin him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin sissy, up on stage, screamin how people hate you
They don't hate you
They just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin my ass
Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song I'm tryin to pre warn you
Lethal when I fuckin see you dawg I'm swingin on you
Motherfuckers must think cause I'm in trouble with the law
that I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow

Y'all some   girrrrls   y'all are some god damn girls
Why do you act this way   Why do you act this way huh
Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies you pussies
keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that
And we all knowwww   we all know, hah
How fuckin cowards rollll   keep rollin rollin rollin
In fuckin Bentley's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow dowwwn

Eminem
Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
and I won't put you in 'em
Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
and I won't put you in 'em

Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
and I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
See I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all of my dogs, from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel Man, 'til I'm hoist away
in my coffin I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again though nope
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin off me
I'm not bein cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin me
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger hey
I say Fuck Christina he says Fuck Christina but meaner
So from doin a song with Method to beggin to get accepted
I'm peggin Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin you up punk, you're dead Don't think that I'm playin
And fuck BIZKIT Cause I know you're sayin fuck D 12
Only not to our face, under your breath, to yourselves

You little   girrrrls   motherfuckin females
Why do you act this way   Why do y'all act this way huh
Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies you pussies
keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that
And we all knowwww   now we all know the truth
How fuckin cowards rollll   keep rollin rollin rollin
In fuckin dent me's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow dowwwn

Eminem
Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs

and I won't put you in it

And that's it, that's all there is to it dawg
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin song
don't say you're down with doin the fuckin song
and then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin MTV talkin about
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog
just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
That's all you had to fuckin say, I wouldn'ta said shit
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin song myself
and not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckin you up shit when I see you
And I will see you too; oh, and by the way Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
Haha..

Eminem

Swifty McVay
I remain fatter than gluttony
Tapin bombs to the back of record companies
Blow 'em up if they ain't want me
The national guard, they scared to hunt me
I love beef; I got you hoes duckin me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggaz in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if ya wanna biatch
It's this lyrical piranha 
Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes endin up in a fuckin mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screamin
Keep the motor on then I'm leavin I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch

Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you

Bizarre
I'm a alcoholic, with the fuckin toilet
Pass the hotdogs Bizarre aren't you Islamic
Bitch shut your fuckin mouth
I'ma keep eatin 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house
with a chain saw to cut me out me out, me out
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
And all women ain't shit   only good for cookin, cleanin 
and sucking dick and thats it I said it
I was responsible for killin John Candy
Got Jon Benet Ramsey in my '98 Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody; truly yours the idiotic Bizarre

Eminem
My adolescent years weren't shit 'til what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignorin the shit how borin it gets
when there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwin a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Its they who rapped me and say they can take me
Its they who legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry
I'll shit on you I'll spit on you 
start pissin and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin, I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spillin my guts like chicken cordon blew and
straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch 
on his skit on his last album
Pull my pants downward..

Kon Artis
Is Richard Pryor still alive
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dyin what
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang it
Bitch bring it, these niggaz that I hang with
I hang you up naked by your ankles danglin oww, oww
My need I stay stranglin, I don't need your help
If you gon' give me the pussy
I'll un loosen my belt I'll shit on you
I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest

Kuniva
Yo it's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk 
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
hey, hey, hey I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
Thats like D Bo fightin Peablo Bryson I'll shit on you
So what you hollerin and yellin about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fuckin skeleton out
Niggaz get hit wit a two piece; bling bling
Wit a poisonous sting, I'm such a violent thing

Eminem
Once I get on two, hits of X
my disk slips and disconnects
'til I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
c'mon, I'll shit on you Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
and puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters 
and spilling liters of blood like swimmin pools
A lot of people say misoginistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child I'll shit on you

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you
I will fuck you wife if you fuck with me
I'll shit on you

Bitch, I'll shit on you
D 12 will shit on you
I'll shit on you

Your life

Your kids 
Your car
I'll shit on you
Your house
Your spouse
Your rings
Your things
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you

My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons
I never show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
These words are weapons
I never did show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

Eminem
Yo, the rage I release on a page
is like a demon unleashed in a cage
Lunatic, soon as I hit the stage
My mind is like a fuckin stick of dynamite
Onen I get behind the mic
it's like the wick is lit you bitches die tonight
My nine is like a guidin light at night shinin bright
My fuckin grip is tighter than my wife's vagina, psych
These cock suckin cops got my Smith N Wesson
I guess it's time to pick a different weapon, man the shit's depressin
But Swift is getting me a new one for a Christmas present
Swift: Come on Slim, let's go and teach this fuckin bitch a lesson
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
Shady stay creative baby hold your head up, don't you let up
one bit on these motherfuckin suckers you're a soldier  GET UP 
STAND UP FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN, LONG AS YOU BREATHIN
THEY JEALOUS OF YOU MAN THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THEY BEEFIN

Swifty McVeigh
It's that Dirty Dozen renegade
You done pulled the pin out my grenade
.38'sll move your shit up out the way
You niggas wont forget about McVeigh; you got somethin to say
Let it out today or watch these bullets spray
from these ten black fingers huggin these deadly millimeters
that'll make Jeff Dahmer's look like he caught a misdemeanor
See I'm  Dirty , so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater, don't let me see you with yo' heater
You gets whipped with it, tell them motherfuckers Swift did it
You packin somethin special in your crib then bitch get it
I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile uh huh
with this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils
You get splitted and guess what, I'm blowin up the hospital
and wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a hoe
I'm Hannibal Lector, the spinal cord disconnector
Findin whores to lock 'em up in motels to inject 'em

Bizarre
I'm eatin crews like I'm Hannibal
There's no way I can be the gay rapper
Eminem: Why not I only fuck animals Oh Ha ha
Stupid trick got my dick startin to itch
Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch
One on one in this bloodsport
I'm in divorce court, sold my bitch off a pack of Newports
Your honor Six times I been arrested; how would you feel
if you was a Jehovah witness that always got molested
It happens I'm smokin dank drikin drank
I can't have any kids cause I'm fuckin shootin blanks
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck
Nicole's a whore   I'm glad O.J. murdered the slut uhh
Responsibility   I'm negligent
Bill Clinton's a fag, should be stabbed 
Let Richard Simmons be the President ohh HEYY
Call me a weirdo, call me Bi zarre
while I stick it up yo' ass while you shittin diarrhea

Eminem
Yo

It's it's be be cause cause of of
these drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do
Be.. cause.. of..
these drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do

It was like.. whoahh and then the fuckin room started spinnin and shit
And my friend came in he was like, Yo Yo Em Em
You puttin that shit up your nose again
And I was like, Naw nuttin like   everything was just spinnin
I couldn't even see and like, he started to look like a monster n shit
Then I just started laughin and threw up all over the fuckin floor
It's crazy

It's because, of these drugs, that I do, that make me
do these things, that I do, do these things, that I do

Eminem
My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it
It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it
You probably do what it said to do just from listenin to it
It's got the power to get you to do it c'mon
So when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off
Some bitch get slapped, some motherfuckin kid get stomped
So get this song, go run out and buy this disc
And try this shit, as much coke as I just did
Cause times like these, got me doin lines like these
Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed
It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does
and is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids

Bizarre
Hey Stephanie hi Let's take some ecstasy okay
Now pull your pants down bitch and have sex with this dog next to me
huh 'Til I'm dead I'm takin blunts to the head
Needles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead
These mescalines got me sure
that I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour
Who slipped this downer in my Snapple
Cussin out Interscope Bizarre, you're signed to Capitol
Fuck it, I was born with half a brain
Sniffin 'caine, at celebrity basketball games
You motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick
cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit UNNNNGGGHHH
The last time I sniffed blow
I ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show
Bizarre be smokin a half a pound
Fuckin the engineer's wife, while he's mixin my song down

It's like, back when I first went on tour
I like, went crazy I was like out of control
And   just was fuckin wasted every night, like
wakin up the next morning like   where the..
Where the fuck am I at, what the fuck is goin on
you see what I'm sayin  I was just like, out of control

Swifty McVay
These Benadryls got me stiffer than a mannequin
Eight years old swallowin Anacins, standin over my bannister
Laughin with a chromed out caliber hahahahaha
The weed that I'm sellin this  look like the back of a tarantula
I keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura
Smashin it, after framin a nigga with smack and dust
I'm scandalous, drugs been ran for months
Crackin capsules to expand our blunts
I rolled it up and take the pressure to the head
Now I'm lookin like a extra on Night of the Living Dead
until they find me on a stretcher
I'm quick to sample anything, bitch you got a tester
This crank'll have me blowin up banks like Uncle Fester

Proof
Ahhhh.. watch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend
Pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines
Ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens
Got a Jell o spleen, and see yellow rings ohhhhhh
Blue pills, and purple mushrooms
Hey little girl, you got a curfew, don't you
Missin since yesterday, perfect just for rape
See I'm on judgment day, numb from special K
Two tabs of X and vitamin C
Swallow Hennessey along with Tylenol 3
Grindin the teeth at the signs of the E
I lost six days at a time in the week
The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom
while D 12 gang rape Marilyn Manson
In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic
Barf up my stomach linin, drown in my vomit

Cause I like, I always tell people   yknowhatI'msayin like
If you got an addiction, don't admit, to nobody, yknowhatI'msayin
Keep that shit to yourself; because if anybody sees that, yknahmsayin
when you're out in the public eye and shit
they're always gonna think that you're on that shit even if you're not
That's why I always tell my friends, knowhatI'msayin but
I mean, like for me, I don't give a fuck
I'll probably end up, dyin from this shit one day
Probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like
Eminem dies from, drug overdose   youknowhatI'msayin And
And my friends, they ain't no fuckin better, yknowhatI'msayin
They ain't nothin but influences, bad influences to me, y'know
It's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure
That's what it boils down to   and, I give in to it
So do they..

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 ,4, 3, 2, 1
Ready or not here we come, here comes trouble in the club
11, 12, 13, pistols big as M 16's
How the fuck we sneak in with this many heaters in our jeans
Nina, two nina's, a peice and they don't even see us
Some shit pops off we squeeze each one, they gonna think it's machine guns
Vanos vo vano, bananas in our flannels
Hands around our colt handles, hold them like roman candles
So, vannas vo vannas, banana fanna fo fannas
Who come back all bananas, banana clips loaded
Managers, bouncers, and the club owners, the motherfuckers don't want us
To come up on and rush in the club and run up in it with a bunch of
Motherfuckers from Runyan, steady poppin them onions
Ready set to go nut up, prepare to tear the whole club up
Fixin to get into some shit, just itchin to choke someone up
You know we finna loc'n when we mix coke with coke and nut rum up
So yeah, yeah, oh what up, see my people throw shit up
See you talk that hoe shit now, when you down you wont get up
And can't sit up your so slit up, the ambulance won't sew you up
They just throw you up in the trunk once they tag your big toe up
Heater no heater, automatic no matic
Mac or no mac it don't matter if I have or don't have it
You never know what I'm packin so you just dont want no static
And open up a whole can of whoop ass, you dont wanna chance to
Risk it no biscuit, milli mac or mac milli
Really wodie dont be silly, homie you don't know me really
You're just gonna make yourself dizzy wonderin what the dealy
Fuck it let's just get busy D Twizzy's back in the hizzy

Get up now let's get it crackin, yeah, it's on and poppin

What the fuck you waitin for get off the wall and quit hatin

I keep a shit load of bullets a pit bull to pull it out
closed
Permanently, you get burned until I quickly
You can not hit me niggas to terrified to come get me
When the reaper comes, the repercussion gon' leave your blood
Inglewood, steppin' without a weapon, you leave, you gone
I be still rollin with stolen toasters while on parole
Snatch you out our home, like eviction notices hoe
When I unload, I'm known to never leave witnesses to roam
When I'm blowed, I'll write the wicked in scroll at the toll
When I'm sober I'm prone to roll up and disconnect your soul, nigga

Kuniva aka Rondell Beene
Now it's been proven it's about to be a misunderstandin
Cause niggas don't know the difference, you bitches just stick to fiction
It's sickenin, you can't even walk in my jurisdiction, rippin it
Grippin the pump, and who wanna fuck with a walking psychopathic
Pyromaniac Shady cats with eighty gats
And maybe that's the reason that you gon' get it the worst
And since you jumpin in front of everybody you gon' get it first
I dispurse the crowd with somethin vigor and versatile
And it's not a joke, it's some kind of riddle
Kunizzle will lift up a 12 gizzle and throw a party from my equittle
And a glock that you will stop you from walkin
Bullets'll hit your liver, I'll even shoot Native Americans
Hit you in your back with a knife and get it crackin tonight

Hahaha, Yeah, D 12, we baacckk
Haha,Em: Get up now Hahahaha
Runyan Ave soldiers, Amityville
Who the fuck want it with us...nobody

Bizarre

All he gon' do is talk about hoes and smokin crack
If your wife is pregnant, I call a whore
Leave her no money, and go out on tour

I'm a Trick Daddy nigga, so bitch how you figure
that I wouldn't turn my niggaz on to you when I hit ya
I probably could forget ya if I hadn't been drunk
but choke a dunkadunk, keep my mind on hump
When my mind's on hump to me my .9's in the trunk
and Denaun got a line for every fine bitch I hunt
Not once, twice, but three times the lover
that your man is, and I'm a freak undercover
I got plans for you, trick, I don't need a baby mother
I got five of them motherfuckers tryin' to smother me already
We can't go steady, but you can give me head
Give me that, get the hell out my bed, and leave the shit
My chap lips will cut nipples when breast fed
and on the way, leave the bread with Achman
I'd love for you to stay but I got another date
with a fat chick that eat cake on playskates
She rubbed my funky ass feet and feed me grace
plus my man in the closet ran out of videotape

Swift
I'ma make this one thing clear
Ain't no woman hear gon' ruin my career
All the hell you doin' is pursuin' a dream
that's when you find out that life ain't truly what it seems
All these hoes be lyin', bullshittin' each other
And why the hell Kobe Bryant didn't wear a rubber
He might as well have went and told the hoe that he love her
I'm sure as hell ain't gonna go to court for my mother
or my wife, and my sisters. So motherfuck a mistress
They signin' a contract before these bitches hit this
Never will a woman take me out that way
I keep a RCA camera in there motherfuckin' face

Bizarre
What's your name again It doesn't matter
My name is Bizzy, a bodygaurd for Mr. Mathers
Sit down girl. Let me get you a drink
I'ma buy you a mink, and rape you in the sink
From day one, I knew you was a hoe
I put a rubber on my toe and fucked you some mo'
Turn around, let me see your nasty ass
Put on a Jason mask while I take off your maxi pads

Kuniva
These hoes be on some bullshit. Always tryin' to pull shit
outta they ass. Get mad and put you on blast
Tell 'em bitches how she fucked you
sucked you, put it on you, boned you
Yappin' off with they mouth sayin' she loved you
All on your dick, callin' your phone, spazzin' and shit
Havin' a fit until you feel like callin' it quits
Then she starts callin' your chick
wantin' to fight. Everytime you show up at a gig
she front row with her friends. Flippin' you off
Follow you to the bar, the bathroom
the parkin' lot, to the car, pissin' you off
Until you blackout, now you and the hoe is havin a scrapout
You get locked up for assault and now you asked out

I don't know dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
Cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everybody's got a fuckin problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because.

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
Sup ladies my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby
They're all like Oh my God it's him
Becky oh my fucking god it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God dude you fucking rock
Please won't you please let me suck your cock
And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're trying to steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me be

Bridge   Eminem 3x
My band my band my band

You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Pro Tools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no I'm Swift oh I thought you were Kuniva
What the hell is wrong with our dressing room
Cause my shit is lookin smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doing jumpin jacks whiling get whipped on my back

Look at Em little punk ass thinking he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
Eminem: No I had an interview, not you two
You gon be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man, I'm a say something
Hey yo Em Eminem: You got somethin to say
Man nothing I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Man I'm a tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we supposed to be a crew
Man I was bout to talk right after you, I swear
Aww man whatever I swear man

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to the amusement parks
I'm gon let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
Eminem: Hey yo it's.. 
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear Hey dude I love your band
We ain't a band bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys acting funny every area code
Eminem: Proof carry my bag bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you Where's Obie and Dre

God damn it, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artis   slipped me some crack
'Lose Yourself' video I was in the back
'Superman' video I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall ask us the questions
Like who's D12 how we get started What about Eminem
Bitch are you retarded
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomache, bitches think I'm cute hey sexy
50 told me to do situps to get buff
Did two and a half and then couldn't get up
Fuck D12 I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

Eminem Singing
Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
And it just tares my ass apart to know that you dont know my band

These chicks don't even know the name of my band ha ha
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands fuck Marshall
Cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

Bridge

Bizarre
The hottest boy band in the world   D12

Eminem as a Salsa singer
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girl's to take off their underpants
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girl's want to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single it's called 'My Salsa'
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls wanna dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa
Where'd everybody go

Now out of all the women in the place
You got me staring at your pretty face
And what that body I can truely say
That U R The One, U R The One, U R The One
Amazed by the way that you shake them hips
Shaking ya ass all on my dick
I get aroused by them sexy lips
Cause U R The One, U R The One, the only one that can move...

Swifty
And you wonder why I call you every day of the week
And have the operator breaking on yo line when you speak
And I can say I'ma make you mine in a blink
You nominated just for your behind and I'm geek
You a thug with yo best of friend mud wrestelin
Sitting in the corner with a mug and a cup of Gin
See me looking for you and yo in in the pens see I hug you dirty
You confronting me for flirting
You wanted me to suddenly my company's a burden
But I won't jump off balchony and how can I be hurting
I'm just playing with you and it's working
Yo friends can't save you, they faking like they nurses

Bizarre
The first time I saw you up in them Guess
You the only reason I use Federal Express
Shit.. I don't be having no packages
Now I'm getting dressor lamps and big mattresses
I go crazy when I smell your odor
I just wanna pick you up and take you to Ponderosa
Steak and potatoes whatever you want
Alright just the buffet my publshing check didn't come
You don't care about D12 you don't know about Bizarre
All you know is that I'm weird and I wear a Wonder Bra
THat's fine... I just wanna make you mine
Niggaz say you a 3 I think you a dime

Proof
I love the way your body gridin all in my face
Only thing that's on your mind is which wallet to rape
Yo ass look so perfect with your thong on your waist
Built like a stallion you belong in a race
Got money by the barrell king kong in the place
Movie and a dinner is as long as I wait
Hey I ain't in your ear all talking dates
Got you dizzy off the crissy you ain't walking straight
Got a room key in yo booty and lets cultivate
You so pretty love them titties they soft and fake
Bring yo friends damn you skin smell like coffee cake
Yo meet me at the place when you get off at 8

Kuniva
The way you moving got me bugging out
And you quit to take off your jacket and slug it out
We thug it out pouring 40s out, We give each other dap
In fact We both hate going out we both hate small gats
You the truth yo for real yo I love you to death
And if we break up I'ma stalk you and bug you to death
Until you scared to leave the house because you know I'm in the bushes
We went from hugs and kisses onto shoves and pushes
It's all love take it in stride I'm only joking with you
I don't get down like that, you know I'll never hit you
But still and yet if I ever feel I'm about to
I'll gently grab your shoulders  SHAKE THE SHIT OUT YOU , girl..

Kon Artist
I take 'em light skin, dark skin short and black
Attitudes sassy and they ass is fat
Corporate suburb but you can be a classy rat
Louis Vuitton cost too much to have a bag to match
Girl forget all that, I'm getting rich off rap
And you can be my A&R as long as you got my back
Sagittarius are entrepreneurs and that's a fact
And your birthday is seven days after mine correct
Well that's two thing we got in common baby
Hope it ain't a problem that I'm involved with Shady
Cause come next year I will not be dating
Cause my plans to be with yo stanken ass ok, ok, ok

Good morning  Haha.
Wake your motherfuckin asses up
Aiyyo, what if so what
Well come on then, you know what time it is

Eminem
For whatever it's worth, it's worth me havin my ass whipped
Cause I'ma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
I just can't get passed these little piss ants
that wanna be Barney bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it, cause we can and they can't spit
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens and I snap then it's a wrap
Then it's a scrap and it isn't rap, is it
Hip hop isn't a sport anymore
when you gotta go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned, but my passion
is to smash anyone rappin without havin to slap him
Believe me, I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol
when I'm pissed now, but it all depends on just how
far it gets took on the mic
Cause I'm tellin you right now you're not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
You poke a stick at a pitbull you get bit B
Your words stick to you like crazy glue when you diss me
Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets do 50
I'm the beautiful instinct, and you're gonna miss me
when I'm gone, like Keith Murray when he threw his stool
and hit a girl accidentally ahh
I do this with Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy and Proof   are you with me

Well c'mon then, everybody good mornin
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
Cause we get it on and, 'til the break of dawnin
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin 'til 6 in the mornin
So ever sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good mornin

Swifty
They consider me the epitomy of a beef starter
In the party with heat, it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs, I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantly poppin slugs, they hot son, better not run AHH
The bosses of all bosses; a holocaust to whoever ain't cautious
In a house full of dog shit
I'm a gothic death prophet, you'll stop breathin
You'll die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like it's Seasons Greetings
Either that or we'll be beefin frequent
You niggaz need an E just to speak shit
And your heater is a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I'll snipe you with it and won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from the mind of a mental patient
When glocks sway you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave

Kon Artis
Yo, yo   I heard you niggaz
don't like us but so what, this beef is like what the fuck
did he say in his rap   am I conceded  He just a punk
I mean these niggaz'll squeeze on me pleased when seein guts
I don't need no enemies cause my family a couple trucks
to fight you in front of everyone important that I don't like
No need for metaphors to get points across when I write
This emotion's enough to say, Fuck you bitch and I don't like you
WHAT  I might as well give this up, but that'd be selfish as fuck
You'll leave D12 in this, but we can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much, c'mon fellas get up
We gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, C'MON

Kuniva
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off of the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparkin a fifth
Your carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out, shootin at G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe
you speakin on movin ki's, but every time we hear you kick it
The only thing that you sellin is woof tickets
I look wicked cause niggaz'll test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back or get your guts clapped
outta your stomach, and when they want it
I'll bring a hundred niggaz from Runyon so get to gunnin if you comin

Eminem   Talking
So I changed huh, you got a phone
Pick up and call me

How Come.. we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. we ain't even beefin now
After all the years we've been down.. ain't no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We family.. ain't a damn thing changed.. unless its you

We were so young 
So full of life and vibrance 
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side 
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes 
And a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it 
You even had the same type of childhood I did 
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succaim to yours 
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it 
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us 
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe I just cant describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it
Your cold your touch is just like ice 
And your eyes is a look of resentment
I can sense it and I don't like it

How Come.. we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. we ain't even beefin now
After all the years we've been down.. ain't no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We family.. ain't a damn thing changed.. unless its you

On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
For I let him disrespect me, or check me over some 
Worst some bitch that I wasn't with
I woulda hit it and quit
But you were p'aing to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her
You would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her
Stumbling half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or somethin
But me catching her fuckin other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
Cause you were offin' your mouth to people like you wanted with me
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
And every sister, fares and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I aint your man and lying like she cant be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth
Dont hate the game or the player
The one thats changing is you

How Come.. we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. we ain't even beefin now
After all the years we've been down.. ain't no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We family.. ain't a damn thing changed.. unless its you

Its gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch
Get ta speaking all rude fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snappin
And poof it just happen 
But proof is just acting out the part he was thrown 
Shady made it so my babies aint starving at home 
See the devil in your glance
Since the ghetto we been friends, forever real intellegence 
Thats forever till the end 
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the satan in your lies 
Aint wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
HOW COME When you talk it's with bitter and spite
AND HOW COME It's my fault for what you did with your life 
And everytime I go to hear you play, you look away 
We barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face

How Come.. we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. we ain't even beefin now
After all the years we've been down.. ain't no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We family.. ain't a damn thing changed.. unless its you

Y'all better leave dat boy alone, cause if they don't
Y'all know he gon' come back on 'em
And they don't want him to come back strong
I wouldn't durr get dat dere boy goin
I said leave dat boy alone, cause y'all don't know him
Dat dere boy he out cold
And dat dere boy he been known
To stir some shit up when he in that zone

Bridge   Eminem
Better leave dat boy alone
Better leave dat boy alone
Better leave dat boy alone
Cause you don't want to get dat boy goin
Better leave dat boy alone
Better leave dat boy alone
Better leave dat boy alone
Cause you don't want to get dat boy goin

It's my attitude that's makin me bust shit, I ain't to be fucked with
So basically niggas wastin they time tryin to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Returnin bows 'fore you be lookin at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
With a mag and I'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation, I run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her gun to mouth resuscitation
A niggas information, they hunted and they sad
Got 'em mad cause they shittin through their stomach in a bag
We comin too strong so it's irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson
When you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancin
Comin near us is the worst mistake that could ever happen
When I'm in my vehicle, I'm pullin you in
I gaurantee that the world will never see you again

Honest to God I usually try to keep to my self
But it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well
Let me explain somethin to ya, a real street nigga
Ain't tryin to get in the streets, he's tryin to get out, feel me
And he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some gun hoe punk
At least a soldier in the army lose his life for a cause
Y'all niggas dyin over pride just to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, I dont play beef
You borrow guns, I own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's wrong that you hoes thinkin you can't really get sleep
Cause you laid a nigga down without any meat
My conscience won't allow me to make decisions in vein
I'm a mayne I do my biddin and I do it again
If you take it to that level, I take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Ave forever

Now people know I live triflin I express it through writin
If you can't feel it, then I must express it through fightin
And I just bought me a gauge and added on a new knife
And I strike people so fast people think I threw lightning
Clash with a few titans, blasted a few hype men
Plus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you wilin
Cause as soon as you drivin I'm a spit a few five ones
And I love to kunive son, and you let the live run
I know how to hide guns, skinny or wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You lookin for hoes, and up in here you goin find none
You niggas done tryed once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stuck till your eyes shut
No time for the wild ones, I'm writin these five words
Fuck you dick ridin' niggas count it, it's five words

Broken beer bottles, when we walk in you can smell trouble
Elbows flying, bitches crying, niggaz bleeding
You retreating, running to your car and skating off, re G'ing
We examples outta you haters running yo mouth
You reason why you peoples is pouring they 40's out
Dirty Dozen wiling, beat niggaz bloody
And you gon have to pour out a keg for all your homies

I was raised by drunks so I became a drunk
80 Proof on this vodka, that's the name I want
I'm in the club to beef, you gotta murder me dead
Only talk to a bitch   wit burgundy hair
On the Isle in the Vette, bumping Seven Duece
See that top on that 40, you know it's coming loose
See me on the ave daily, be running this shit
If your chick get loud I'll G Money that bitch
Packing mags and clips, I'll smash ya clique
Because of Proof they put the G in the alphabet
Smoking weed, drinking Henny, Remy and that Jimmy
Don't worry if you run out the corner store I got plenty

B Real
Yeah homie
I thought we told we been fuckin' loco
Cypress Hill, D12 bitch

I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name, never say it in vain cause I'm a psycho

Bizarre
We fuckin' crazy
We'll fuckin' snap in a minute bitch

Swifty McVay
I'm a motherfuckin' omen, I bow down to no man
Split a nigga open, killin' folks compulsive
A soldier with a motive, scrotum big as boulders
I hold 'em then unload on you, put it on a poster
So everyone can notice who was focused on us
Pokin' they nose in our business, hopin' that I don't come smoke 'em
No one knows my notions or emotions, I'm a vulture
You niggaz close to croakin' any moment and I know when
I could fuck the culture up, probably rap
A maniac wit' anxiety attacks, I don't wanna chat
Speak when you spoken to
And I don't have to read a fuckin' magazine or quotable
To notice what you ho's will do

Kuniva
We all soldiers
We move as a unit, we all roll up
And show up at your residence, light your front door up
Get scared, life ain't fair
And I'm prepared to blast you just as fast as Dre can say Hell yeah
So watch what you say
cause it can happen either today or the next minute
I can draw the heater and spray and I'm dead serious
You could be dead period, end of story
I'm on your porch wit' a gun and your son, sippin' a forty
Nobody can hold me, I does it all by my lonely
I stomp your head when you awake, you be looking like Gumby
Aftermath and Shady bitch, you can read it and weep
You see my poster in the 'hood for the G of the Week

I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
heh, you know what I am crazy, heh, it' hell, haha
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name, never say it in vain cause I'm a psycho
heh, nigga I'm 'bout to snap at any minute nigga evacuate

Bizarre
They found Saddam, but they ain't gonna find me
I'll be under a tree in Buttfuck, Tennessee
And I don't know too much about my daddy
Except he spit in my face and fucked me in my fanny
I ain't a racist, I just hate whites
Fags and dykes, blacks and tranvestites
Thirteen years old and joined a fuckin' gang
Hair under my ass cheeks feeling the fuckin' pain
Am I insane Who really knows
Cause any second my temper can fuckin' blow
I get colder than December
Black the fuck out, tomorrow won't even remember
See Bizarre can show you what violence is all about
And this Dr. Dre beat done brought it the fuck out
Run in your house and put a gun in your mouth
And blow your brains the fuck out

Eminem
I probably got a screw loose or two, or maybe three or four of 'em
Some fell out and hit the floor
All I know is ever since my fuckin' head hit the snowbank
I been a little Neanderthalish, no thanks to my man D'Angelo Bailey
But I just take it slow daily, my biggest dilemma's
Tryin' to figure whether to use the flat head or the Phillips
Or just go to the Home Depot and pick the new power drill up
Gives me two hours and six days and I'm still up
I feel like I'm about to snap any minute
There's a new Tower Records about to stop and get a fill up
Pick the new Cypress Hill up
And go find who did that shit to Xzibit
And go fill up a whole liquor bottle with piss
And shatter his fuckin lips wit' it

I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name, never say it in vain cause I'm a psycho

Kuniva
Cornell Pitts a.k.a. Bugz
Rest in peace homie

Bugz
Fuck that Who run shit once these drums hit

Here's a can of asswhip, for you to come get
Yo' click made they trip, I make them hoes suck mint
Ask them girl, they know the scoop, don't fuck with Bugz bitch
I chop off her titty, have you suckin one tit
Them pink belly niggaz, is who you run wit
Makin half ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate yo' damn sound, don't like it one bit
You could make a double album, won't have one hit
Your entire outfit, is on some bullshit
And there's not a damn one that I can't outwit
I ad mit, that my style is unfit
for momma's baby boy, because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit, larceny, give harm quick
You pull the alarm switch I stab you in your armpit
Now who the nitwit wanna come get wit
this egotistic hip hop fundamentalistic
Don't risk it, you get your shit split
Now keep your distance, and keep existance
I'm persistant when it comes to bend shit
Smoke the, blunt with my judge right before my sentence
I'm relentless, to deny is senseless
Yo' bitch pay my bill, that's where the hell yo' rent went

DJ Green Lantern
D 12, We ain't goin' nowhere..
We still smokin' crack, nigga..

Bitch, keep talkin, keep on poppin off

Keep on poppin that shit you poppin

We ain't got to prove shit to y'all

Em: Come on Yo, the derelict's back, I'm blazin niggaz

You niggaz is bitches, straight up, I'm bearin the facts
And nigga, I'm top pedigree, so don't play with me
Kids and all get hit, peers and all
Kuniva's a street talker, heatsparker to beefstarter
Packin guns when I'm sleepwalkin Em: Bitch, keep talkin
Knife with the hands, never bow down to another man
I was poppin guns while you was still poppin some rubber bands
Smother your clan, sever your hand and your legs
And mail your brother your heart, and send your mother your head

Swift
I'm the only one, you bitch, that touch ya, type of brother
A belligerent and rowdy motherfucka
That'll dump your body, and still fly away to Maui on Atella
When it comes to beefin, it ain't no explainin
I change your language with a stainless
I'm contained wit an anguish to leave you famous
Niggaz don't say shit, fuck your hype man
I'll be shooting 7Up in your mouth, man
I'm about to sell your mama bud, and lace it
So when she fire it up she coughin blood, I love to see 'em wasted
I'm made to behave in this case
You try to be brave in a rage your legs will be replaced

Em: Bizzy, come on I ain't here to talk about Benzino, or Ja Rule
I'm here to talk about Lil' Ray Ray, and what I'ma do
Sorry, I ain't gonna mention you, you'll probably sue
Next week, this shit'll be out on DJ Clue exclusive
The first time I had sex, a dirty mattress
No condom, my grandmother bent over backwards Ugh
Bizarre been fuckin raw all summer
Psych I'm not bisexual
I'm an intellectual transexual with one testicle One nut
And I ain't sayin shit cause it rhyme
I got colon cancer   I'm dyin

Proof
Yay i yay
Rest in peace Jam Master Jay
2 Pac, and Notorious B.I.G., c'mon

I'm widely the best, God in the flesh
Blow your heart out of your chest
Leave your body a mess, streets bloody as hell
Study my 12, I cut him he fell
A druggie on bail, nutty as well
With search light, bud he revealed, dead or in jail
They're headed for hell
Together with bells and blonde guy, get your lungs hard
We can take this from your front door to your CEO office
Got the key to your coffin Em: So bitch keep talkin
Leavin your office, we takin over
Or get Chyna White, mixed with baking soda
Ya hear me...GET CRACK

Eminem
Fuckin' crackheads
And this is just mixtape shit, you fuckin' morons
This ain't brains over brawn
This is bullies over fuckin pussies

Guess who
New shit
D12 World
D Twizzy

You don't got a reason to want no beef
You ain't got no ends to justify the means
You don't got a cause, you better put it on pause
You don't got the balls to fit in them draws
So whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed
You better start rethinking and thinking it fast
Ain't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask
You better put them brakes and let off the gas
And Slow Your Roll

Teenas a menace to many, I'm not friendly you get shot in the Kennedy fast
You popped willingly you walkin around with Pac's identity
I'm a mockery you 'bout to watch what it's fin to be
I'm not mentally focused but lyrically we got it locked
And it's not about droppin albums, I'll sock a nigga on the spot
You can't help it but to imagine this walkin massacre
A madman strapped with a magnum blow that spasm out ya back
And just stand there and snatch your medallion
See I can't fear any nigga that can not happen
The immaculate Mack handler
That got this wrappin by the back of his neck
A scavenger I'm a threat then you fear me like a hand full of syringes
I'm ill enough to scream at your front do', blow it off the hinges
I'm marksmatic to press marxman outta walkin
Cause soon your body can catch me shootin up your carcus
So don't provoke shit, I wish the whole mankind was a neck so I can choke it
Furocious and you ain't gonna be knowin where ya folks is
Fuck the milk cartons and posters
It's over, they ghosts

Niggaz is bitch instead of diggin a ditch
I'ma see how fill this river can get even bitches get hit
I'm walk dog on all fours embark'em with long claws
Just fight for the wrong cause your boss with thong drawers Oh No
You ain't in my racket bitch followin faggots wit wanksta tats on their ass
Magic Stick If I get hit once you get hit twice   backwards
These thugs need to do what he love and just play the back
Before I'll Put A Sword On Ya Head Like A Raider Cap
You bust I'm sprayin back, leave your hood layin flat Wraaa
Now what you gonna say to that

Pull up the candy truck
Throw up, blow up, beat a handicap bitch up
Fuck Butter I kill the DJ
I don't need you bitch I got a instant replay
Lay down bitch get butt naked
And fuck the viagra I'm tryna nut in two seconds
All around the world, fuck wit different cliques
You ain't got no weed get the fuck out my room bitch

I'm calm but I steal on niggaz like I was clepto
Put that chrome shit to ya head like you was Destro
Why stop niggaz, why not pop niggaz, we cop figures
Keep them toast like I hop nigga, we breathe dirt so be alert
Or get them guns on ya chest like a Welcome to the Hood T shirt
Let's go back before throw backs, before I dro sacks
I used to blow gats, bullets'll find you like a low jack
I'm hopeless, a ferocious dosage of dope shit
A culprit of culture a chaotic comotion
Kuniva will blow shit off the map I post it
Knock you off your penny load so fuck that cold shit

I point my fingers to the ground, throw my waist to left of me
To knuckle should ship like a Em upside down and you best be
On your P's and Q's people we sees to use
No one see's your views, so now you see's exclusives
And put it in your little magazine, but you should
Know that was the most desperate thing that you could
Pull out of your crotch you faggots all owe us much
Start doing heroin lines for as much as you gossip
Like bitches with Oscars, ya'll actresses
45's make bodies flip like flabby tits
Bullets coming at your door like a buck up 6th
Now what the fuck you gonna do to get up out of this shit
Your record was sellin 10 years ago you dumb bitch
Do the math, you'll never have a Shady/Aftermath ring
And that kind of staff to back that ass up so back that ass up
Before we clap that ass up ..

Nigga you better ask somebody
These niggaz think they can just put shit out on their own
Fuck'em ..

Yeah yeah
Told you we'd be back told you we'd be back
Welcome to hell welcome to hell

Eminem
There's a switch, I flip, emotions cut off
So cold I done froze my butt off
And this ain't even the tip of the iceberg yet
It's like squirtin a squirt gun in the ocean, fuck off
Other words, I ain't put a dent in the game 
compared to the damage I have yet to do
As long as you still have feelings to hurt
I'll be around as long as you let me get to you
Long as I got two balls to palm
I'll be the bomb, you just a false alarm
Get scant little pissants 
and see if I don't come along and stomp your farm
Thunder and lightning, rain, hail, sleet 
with a tornado's the kind of brain storm I get
So when wind starts blowin shit
Talk about goin in Goin insane's more like it
Wizard of words when he spits hazardous with it 
like a disastrous blizzard
So you better listen quick fast or miss it
Yeah go ahead little prick bastard, diss it
But when you get hit with a sick ass explicit 
flow don't ask how much of his passion is it
that goes in it, just know that all he knows is that 
it's better to kick ass than kiss it
Dick Dastardly of audacity
Mental capacity unmatched, it has to be
stopped but it can't be, but man I can't just keep 
doin 'em like that or no one'll rap with me yeah
Except one, you ask who is it

Royce Da 5'9
Guess who just came through the blast, you bitches
With the ratchet, the Book of Mathew
A book of matches lightin 'em under white linen
You 'bout to have to admit it
They pass you the mic, ask you to spit it
And you got handed your own ass, your ass in your own hands
I'm sure they gon' laugh when you goin to the bathroom wit it
Now with what would you come against us Better be
somethin, with a Bigfoot pedigree
Easily these are the reasons 
that we need to be in y'all prayers
Each region breeds them MC's that wanna be them 
what means that they wanna breathe our air
With these ideas
Anybody thinkin the game don't need, the Bad and the Evil regime
That's like sayin that the bad boy Piston team didn't need Isaiah

Eminem
Shit piss and bleed, this is a different breed of MC's, I swear
Better beware there's too much at stake/steak 
and to find someone this raw on a beat is rare
You can kiss my ass and eat shit stains 
out my underwear that, I don't even wear

Royce Da 5'9
It's gotta be no fair
It's like hittin the lottery, oh yeah
Who you know hotter There gotta be no pair
Shotty that I got'll lobotomy yo' hair
Classic, smash it, smother it
Read it and weep then perhaps you will have no rebuttal in
fact you seein me in this rappin 
is like sayin Tila Tequila can sing like Jazmine Sullivan

Eminem
Back to bash your skull again
Push a bitch out the Aspen and tell her 
Get the fuck outta Dodge Dodge Aspen
Shouldn't have to explain my metaphors
You has beens are duller than, color books that ain't colored in
Second and third fourth wind, got another wind
Here they come again, none other than 
Bad and Evil, also known as Saddam and Osama Bin
It's been a long time 
but I bet that neither one of us have felt sicker than we do right now
And we only get iller with time
Me and Nickel fuckin shit up on a dime, so tellin us to pipe down's
like talkin to a meth head
Bruce Willis on his death bed, last breath with an infection
Fightin it while he's watchin internet porn 
'bout to meet his death with an erection
My God, what I mean is 
David Carradine jackin his penis in front of his tripod
Chokin his own neck, what part you don't get
I'm sayin I  Die Hard 

Royce Da 5'9
When you listenin to my bars
Nothin but the F I R, E comin out your iPod
We come up in the place 
chicks heads start spinnin like motherfuckin white walls

Eminem   Royce
Got your mother suckin my balls 
while we fuck each other, we punch each other in the eyeballs
And I never say I'm sor ry
The 5'9 and the Fire Marshall 
We, spit with an intensity to shut shit DOWN in the industry
Two different entities with a propensity 
to put these N U T's up inside of your fuckin, mouth

Haha, aw shit, stop it stop it
Yo, welcome to the CD welcome to the CD

Royce Da 5'9
My life's ridin on the Autobahn on auto pilot
Before I touch dirt
Or kill y'all with kindness, I kill ya My natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you been borned or if you conformed
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggaz intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin you bangin, you flamin
Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past so that basically resurrected my cash flow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s, my '90s was like the Navy
You was like the Brady's, you still fly kites daily

Eminem
Catch me in my Mercedes bumpin Ice Ice Baby
Screamin Shady 'til I die, like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin 'bout this nice nice lady
Wait don't stop me now 'fore I get on a roll   danish
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius, really I belong 
inside a dang insane asylum; came to drive them
trailer parks crazy, I am back and I am razor sharp, baby
And that's back with a capital B with an exclamation mark, maybe
you should listen when I flip the linguistics cause when I rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
Cause after I spit the bullets I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics; so get this dick I'ma live this

I'm livin life in the fast lane
Movin at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin life in the fast lane pedal to the metal
Livin life in the fast lane pedal to the metal

Royce Da 5'9
Uhh, yeah
My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle as Captain Morgan attacks my organs c'mon
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the devil that says I'll let you take me
You let me take a shovel, dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian
Go back and forth in, more beef than you can pack a fork in
I'm livin the life of the infinite enemy down, my tenement chimney now
The semi's the remedy pow, spin him around, enterin in the vicinity

Eminem
Now   he's called Eminem but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
He's lookin around this club and it looks like people are havin a shit fit now
Yeah little tr tr trailer trash, take a look who's back in t t town
Did I st st stutter motherfucker Fuck the mall
He shuts the whole motherfuckin Walmart d d down every time he comes a r r round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9 to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin chick underwater he's tryin to dr dr drown
Shorty when you dance you got me captivated 
Just by the way that you keep lickin them dick suckin lips, I'm agitated
Aggravated to the point you don't suck my DICK then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words you don't fuckin give me head then I'ma have to take it

Royce Da 5'9
And then after takin that I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin
It's gon' say the whole rap game passed away on top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
to Michael Jackson's activator woo
Meanin I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data
Rollin over hip hop in a verbal tractor trailer
Homie they sick, you could normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense that these shell cases is just like a bag of paper 
dropped in the lap of a tax evader   homie they spent

Eminem
Now make that ass DROP like a sack of potatoes, what girl I'm the crackalator
Percolator of this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell ya boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You're rollin with a player, you won't be exaggeratin when you say you're livin

Pedal to the metal

The poor stays poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate...
Get outta here

Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
just how far that I can take it
Every rule I'm breakin it

Eminem
Tearable but not rippable, invincible I hung invisible
Fuckin mistletoe over the world
I stuck my ass up under it, now pucker up them lips and kiss it hoe
Here we go, Bad and Evil so you know how this'll go
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches, this is no
joke, goin overboard like someone threw us off the boat
Choke, cough from all the smoke   I'm tryin to stay on fire
so you know if I hate fuckin water sprinklers I don't love the hose/hoes
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff its face
back in that bitch, smother that little motherfucker 'til it suffocates
YOU had long enough of a wait, why are they
tryin to be so secretive Bad and Evil is reunited, hey
Came back to annihilate, the game's in dire straits as I await
Word on Satan as I drop, fall to my knees before this Ouija board and I pray
Now I lay me down to sleep
I do this shit in my sleep, I'm sleepin now, imagine if I awake
I'm champ bitch, I'll never taste the canvas
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy, never mushy so you can't squish
Nowhere near a tush, in fact if I jump out a bush
in a sneak attack's the only way I'll say I am Bush
Outlandish, these  Words Are Weapons  that I brandish
Standoffish to hoes, keep your hands off this
Can't top it, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for Law FUCK protocol
I'd holler at this hoe, but now my throat is sore

Eminem Royce

Royce Da 5'9
Baby I'm lawless, you couldn't burn me if you threw acid on me

You high, thug yeah   go 'head jump
No matter how high you get, you gon' come up short like Spud Webb
My DUI's get waived/waved like sayin bye
Still ridin with no L's like James Todd; can't change I
I thank God for my safe thinkin
Last time I was safe thinkin me and my niggaz was doin a bank job
I stay violent, y'all go the peace route
You got a mouth like Kanye, I'll knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
No disrespect to Mr. West, shit I'm just nice with mine
And this just rap, I'm just like Ricky Hatton, I just like the line
These weak rappers wanna set us up, they never tough
They ask me for a hook, I tell 'em left or right, head or GUT
What y'all messin with is
a nigga that'll leave you FUBAR, Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition
Y'all are rock stars, I'm the opposite, I could just
throw a rock and hit a star, for the FUCK of it
Partner you not hard, I'll body ya hot bars
Beef is left you pray, right, like Allahu Akbar
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot

I'm on everything   sick when I kick it, BARF
I'll crush your brain like a pill crusher, let's crush a pill, yeah
Fuck, I think I just crushed my last Tylenol 3 up
Grab the key up off the counter to the camper, left the crib
Man who'da knew that 3 in the mornin I'd still be up
Could barely see up over the steerin wheel, crash the whip tore a tree up
On my way to the dealers tryin to re up
Call me Brett Favre, spell it F A V R E yup
It's wrong, other words I just fucked my RV up
Bitch it's on again yeah, break that Klonopin in half
while I smoke some chronic in the cab with Donovan McNabb
Then I dye my hair back blonde again and laugh
I'm the real macaroni, you cheesy bitch, I'm demonic with the  Kraft 
There's a devil in my noodle, you Angel hair pasta
Flow's dreaded like some fuckin tangled hair Rasta 
farian, Jamaican, relax man
I'll send a fuckin axe at you if you insist on a fuckin ax sent
Bad and Evil is back with an epidural, check your girl
Cause after we prop you up we're proppin her up
So baby come put your feet up in these stirrups
Your boyfriend better find another fuckin hornet's nest to stir up
We rap like we're on

Royce Da 5'9
I'm on syrup, painkillers, cigarette, speed
Henna hen.. heheh Classic
It's Eminem and him again, my sentiments exactly
I told that bitch to get at me, then the bitch attacked me
Kid you not, I'm lit up as fuck   tablecloth tucked in my pants 
'til I'm hearin dishes drop as I walk away from my  Dinner With Schmucks 

Eminem
Then I enter the front of the K Mart shoppin center 
with a coupon book and a hundred and ten bucks and a bunch of change
And a wife beater with a mustard stain
I'll crush your brain like I'm crushin pills, what the fuck's the motherfuckin deal
This shit's makin me feel like I'm tryin to do a motherfuckin cartwheel up a hill

Royce Da 5'9   Eminem
How many bars How many tabs of A C I D, Y E S

Smoke and Henny in my chest I'm B A N A N A S
I'm a C O C O N U T put this CD in then you'll see
The sequel to Scary Movie, Bad is to Evil, a roofie to Roethlisberger
You don't gonna wind up six feet deep under that shit's creek 
so I hope that you bought preservers

Eminem
You can put a turd on a plate
Silverware and a tablecloth to serve us
You don't bring shit to the table
I'm in your grill like a Seville when a moth gets murdered
You're pushin the envelope 
when I'm shovin that whole post office further
right off the surface of this earth 
into the darkest and the farthest corners

Royce Da 5'9
How many bars How many bars Maui Wowie, Sour Diesel, how many jars
To all my people I'll be to Mars, mami c'mon
She can actually wrap my nutsack around the back of her neck in the bathroom stall
Or she could just puke from sippin this piss from my 24 inch catheter cord

Eminem
I'm the type that'll take a bath with a whore
Drown her, bang her head on the passenger door
while I'm stashin her in the back, smackin her forehead 
on the dash 'til it's accidentally blowin the Benz jeep horn

Royce Da 5'9
My friends be knowin that when I'm on a binge I'm stingy
Even when I'm ten deep in the room in the MGM with Lindsay Lohan and she on

Syrup, painkillers, cigarette, weed

Royce Da 5'9
Uhh, Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefin, first rapper that shot a fan
Gucci's my absolute state of mind like Waka's man
Choppers sprayin, gettin head in the car parked new Gallardo
This bitch suckin my dick today, call it yesterday's news tomorrow
Stretch a nigga out, I'm the new Tae Bo, 'bout to cross over, I'm the new Ivo
'Bout to save a couple of these bitches, that's right, I'm the new Bible
You You five oh, me I'm more grounded than punishments, but I'm too fly though
Y'all niggaz be whinin/wine'in, I should call you Moscato

Eminem
Look down at the floorboard looks like someone left a pair of stilleto shoes in my Tahoe
Never know just what type of a hoe inside of my ride I may let
Last night went to 5 AM and she ain't even recover from last Friday yet
Hoes all over the ride like it's an ice cream truck, I can see why they fret
I already ran over two hoes and I ain't get out the fuckin driveway yet
Soon as I open the door you try to resist, what for 
Get in girl, don't front shorty you're
fightin an unwinnable war
It's useless as tits in a boar or, little tits on a whore
Got 'em actin like spoiled brats kickin and screamin 
like little kids throwin fits on the floor
Get in the whip but you ain't turnin this frog to a prince
Why you tryin to keep convincin me for

I wanna get kissed, kissed kissed You won't get one
I wanna get kissed, kissed kissed Not from me
I wanna get kissed, kissed kissed Not on the lips, are you crazy
I wanna get kissed, kissed kissed Maybe the cheek but that's all you gon' get from me

Eminem
Now ya in my whip just as long as you understand that I can't be WHIPPED
You say companionship, I say abandon ship
I'm a jigolo so you know I'm always on the go
I don't got no time to slow down for no relation SHIT
Drop the P and add a T, yeah you can get mad at me all you want
But I'm ghost before you can even say boo hun, let alone call me one
A one night stand is all he wants with a female fan, yeah one like Stan
And he's so about a one night stand his bedroom has two lamps and only one nightstand
Get the hint Ooh yeah boo; ew, I'm ain't finna argue
But why do you think they call it boo
Yeah cause the sound of it's supposed to scare you

Royce Da 5'9
Oh hoe, we can share you, in the back of the McClaren
I don't give a fuck what your name is
We gon' call you hi and bye, hope you bi, in the meantime your name is Sharon
Slows, the, flow, down, so, I, can, what
Tell you same face I make when I'm shootin the gun's the same face that I make when I FUCK
From the back with my hand on your neck pressin your face against these sheets is insane
You vin change, cause I'm outta this world girl, I got that Milky Way dick vein
I'm at an all time high with highness, I'm at an all time fly with flyness
And this is exactly what they say when they bow to Your Highness, yeah

Royce Da 5'9   Eminem
Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefin, first rapper that shot a fan
Push a chick out the car while it's movin like Waka's man
Her bottom's dark but her top is tan
Her private parts, got her on the pole like the opposite of her poppa's plans
I'm in a trance, man look at this bitch dance
Lookin at this tramp like what are you wearin girl Quit playin
Yeah bitch, are them scratch and sniff pants
What Did I say that I'm on lean like Styrofoam cups and kickstands

Eminem
Middle finger stuck on fuck, stiff hands
But girl you got a butt like no if ands, so yeah what the hell maybe, all hail Shady
He'll tell it like it is so tell Katy Perry he's on her tail, he's tailgating
These bells are my mating call and I'm here, bell's waiting and tell Lady
Gaga she can quit her job at the post office she's still a, mail/male lady
Wouldn't fuck her with her dick, you heard it, the verdict's in, he's allergic to divas
He'll take meat  Cleavers  to 'em; him don't give a damn about Beaver, do him
What a demon, a behemoth, evil just seems to be seethin through him

Royce Da 5'9
I like the little strip tease you doin this evenin, you and 
me gon' find three more chickadees and have a  Minaj  like Nicki
You hot like a Dickie outfit in Texas without shit under it sweatin
Suck my dick or gets to steppin's my logic

Eminem
My God trick, my dick is hard and stiff as a yardstick
What are we gonna do, ride around 'til we're car sick
I'ma put this shit in park like dog shit
And you can blow me in the dark in the parkin lot 
of the trailer park by the garbage
What are you waitin on me to roll out the carpet 
Condoms are in the glove compartment, let's start it
Think I'm jokin What am I sittin here tryin to make
fake farts with my armpits
Tryin to get you to spit pop through your nose 
Am I here to amuse you Stop it

Royce Da 5'9
I'm in yo' pocket on side of a church
The other hand reachin for the bottom of your purse
You're givin me head in a boxin stance
My dick's so big you can drop it in dirt
I'm not yo' man, we sparrin partners
It's, five things you are in charge of
That's   suckin a dick, suckin a dick, 
suckin a dick, suckin a dick, suckin a dick

Eminem
And if you ain't suckin dick why you sittin there with puckered lips 
Oh that's collagen, muh'fuckin bitch
What'chu mean how'd you get suckered into this 
You gon' jump in my truck and then try to get truculent

Royce Da 5'9
You should be sufferin, you should be cookin
You should be bucklin your seatbelt with oven mitts

Eminem
Excuse me while I make an ass out of myself 
but it's only because I just wanna get

Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefin, first rapper that shot a fan

This one's for you and me, livin out our dreams
Where are, right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now, all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighterrrrrrrrs
A sky full of lighterrrrrrrrs

Eminem
By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothin to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck   or get struck like lightnin
Fighters keep fightin, put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uhh
Had a dream, I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's, nipple is mine, for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin illest in this music
there is, or there ever will be; disagree, feel free
But from now on I'm refusing 
to ever give up, only thing I ever gave up's using
No more excuses, excuse me if my head is too big, for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you  dicks  tryin to  kid  Flip dick, you did opposite
You stayed the same cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
Cause it wasn't that, long ago when Marshall sat, flustered lacked luster
Cause he couldn't cut mustard
Muster up nothin, brain fuzzy cause he's buzzin, woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it, wasn't cause he had buzzards
circlin around his head, waitin for him to drop dead, was it
Or was it cause them bitches wrote him off Little hussy ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make What's it take 
to get it through your thick skulls that this ain't
some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage
And let it be known that from this day forward I wanna just say thanks
cause your hate is what gave me this strength
So let them Bic's raise
Cause I came with 5'9 but I feel like I'm 6'8

Royce Da 5'9
By the time you hear this I'd probably already be outtie
I advance like goin from totin iron
to goin and buyin four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me Slow down boy, you goin to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him 
the same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears   my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march 
right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career is LeBron's jersey in 20 years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up, must come down
You goin down on somethin you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy, now I'm just the cat's meow
Oww, out class the count
Always down for the catch weight, like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed   y'all remember when T Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and Auto Tunes
Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from havin my city locked up to gettin treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggaz that's gossipin like bitches
on the radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams starin at a beehive
And how real is that
I remember signin my first deal, now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass
Without the MTV Awards gag yeah

Bruno Mars
You and I, know what it's like
to be kicked down, forced to FIGHT
But tonight, we're alright
So hold up your lights, let it SHIIIIINE
Cause

You're gonna be okay kid. You're gonna be, okay.

Claret Jai
Is everything not enough
What more can I give up
Is there anyone that I can trust
I give you my all and you still take from me

Royce Da 5'9
Uh, always been the type of dude that'd feed my clique
I know that without the fans I ain't shit, but y'all better read my lips
I don't spit raps this ill for you to just hack and steal, and leak my shit so peep my drift
I hope y'all don't think y'all helpin me out with that shit, that shit's stressin me OUT
Nickel Nine is blowin UP   Christmas time you should hang my album 
on top of your fireplace cause around that time my stockin is goin UP
Feels like a victory bittersweet, cause the bigger I get, the bigger the wedge
between the relationship of me and my bigger bro, hear what I said
Feels like the shit was wished on me   everything I do for the nigga and the nigga know 
I would do anything for him but the nigga refuse to quit just straight SHITTIN on me
Keepin yo' distance probably best, if you don't wanna fuck with me
But you know me probably best, fuck pity
You want that You know, it's Laila Ali chest, tough titty
The problem is you got a problem, you think that I'm already set
So I'ma look down on you, just be proud of me, you already got my respect
I ain't tryin to say somethin I'd regret, so I'ma just stop, chasin the pain
Let you deal with the fact that we don't get along cause I got a big face in the game
Sometimes I feel like fuck my LIFE   I fuck with a few niggaz 
that I know if my chick was a shady hoe, niggaz wouldn't think twice 'fore they fuck my WIFE
Guess that's the difference in friends and associates
I done been broke, I done been through the motions
I don't pay no attention to birds, I use my scope and I tend to the vultures
No one ever blows up your phone just to talk, I don't make money just to loan it to y'all
Tell a nigga that think you whylin is like dialin and then talkin to a hole in the wall
Please look at these expenses, these niggaz expensive
If I gotta lend you money every time I see you just to be ya friend bitch
I don't really need your friendship

Is everything not enough
What more can I give up
Is there anyone that I can trust
I give you my all and you still take from me
I give, and I give, and you take, and you take
And you just, walk away, without noth ing to say
You just take from me, ay ay, ayy
You just take from me, ay ay, ayy

Eminem
I live, in a bubble, I struggle with the fame
Trouble is the pain, grows double, give a fuck what you say
When my music you take, so, subtle just to give it away
to people who don't even appreciate flows motherfucker, I'm livid today
Cause I break my back to give you my art
You steal my thoughts, it's like drivin a spike through my heart
You might not think it's that big of a deal to steal from me but music's all I got
Aside from my daughters, not to sound like a martyr but it's gettin harder than I thought
to not just go crazy trapped in this house, I'm about to just snap, am I not
deservin of what I got Did I not work for it Put it all on every record I record
Well then please tell me why on this earth Lord 
does it keep happenin I keep rappin but I wonder sometimes is it worth all
the bullshit cause it feels like a down there ain't no gettin up from
But I won't let it get me down, I won't succumb, I'm anything but glum so FUCK 'EM~
They'll appreciate me when I'm gone, they'll say I was ill, right The way I killed mics
But the way I feel right now it just feels like 
I'm so done with this shit that I may as well wipe
I have nothin else to give you, nothin else to contribute, farewell I bid you
But before I go my last gift to you, ladies and gentlemen Slaughterhouse I GIVE YOU

LOUD NOISES 

Eminem
Life handed me lemons, I jumped back in the public eye
and squirted lemon juice in it, by now you just wish I'd fuckin die
But I electrify, get electrocuted, executed by
the execution of my flow too quick for the human eye to detect zoomin by
They told me to shit, I fell off that pot, hopped right back on that crapper and I
said fuck IT with a capital I, look who's back to antag g gonize
You don't like it you can eat shit, fuck off little faggot and die
You right back like a magnet on my dick grabbin at my
shit better get to the back of the line
If you wanna get your shot at me, what kind of crap is that Battle, what kind 
of rapper would I, be 'Fore I let another rapper think he's hot
I'll bury my face in a stinky twat and go ah ladl lah ladl lah ladl LAH
Girl my head space is limited, ain't even room in the back of my mind
So I ain't thinkin about you, I don't got time, I done told you a thousand times
So how could I find the time to put an Alkaline 
battery in Royce's back and at the same time put juice in mine 
Goddamn it, Slaughterhouse is SIGNED

Crooked I
SLAUGHTERHOUSE

I'm a   menace villian, my pen is sick and spillin, my lyrics killin
Then I let you witness shit when it hit the ceilin
A nigga's willin to give the listeners the sickest feelin
Like mixin some Benadryl and penicillin then I'm fillin
a clip with a written, can you picture my pistol drillin
a million women and children when I'm illin but it isn't real it's
a rap, on the real it's a wrap, how could you possibly stop the apocalypse
when I'm atomic bombin the populous
Shock the metropolis, hostile as a kid, poppin a glock at his
moms and his pops then he hops in his drop, with his iPod rockin his 
Slaughterish documentation of lyrics, I write with confidence
Write like a columnist slash novelist
I'm in this game to demolish it, establish my dominance
over prominent rappers, you poppin shit to ya opposite
I can spit ominous so spit politics
Now I'm Haile Selassie, Gandhi and 'Pac of this hip hop genre BITCH
... SLAUGHTERHOUSE

Royce Da 5'9
Lyrically I'm a cocaine Altoid dope
Ability so brain, it's a no brain bout boy fresh
Physically I'm literally a Cocaine Cowboy, wait wait
Did I just go almost four bars without talkin about my big dick
The other day me and yo' thick bitch had a great date and we ate cake
And then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost 
cause she couldn't handle my Shake Weight, I swear
The irony of Ryan is I am bi polar 
while I'm rhymin standin beside a BIG OL', big ol' white bear
Neither one of us fight fair   you are literally lookin at Woody and Wesley 
in a movie where the white boy ain't got to jump, nowhere cause I'm here
Nigga I'm on fire   yeah, and I'm every bitch's dream
One, two, I'm comin for you; I'm a BIG OL', big ol' NIGHTMARE~

Nah, get a stopwatch clock my flow, hit the button on top watch your jaw drop, oh oh
Dat's dat oh, yaowa   when I drop I go outer space
Black out like Darth Vader's face placed in a molten shower
Say somethin and get done proper, momma poppa pourin out vodka
Mama mia, Em pass me the scee ssors, there's vee sitors in the Slaughterhouse casa
Better jet boy go home, better jet boy G4 chrome
Better  Jet  boy Mark Sanchez, Santonio Holmes, I'm NOT your any old homeboy
Just   sittin in the lab, pickin up a pad
I be spittin bad, I'ma get you mad with this gift I have
Little duck sufferin sickatash when the trigger blast
I'ma put your beak on your fitted hat
RRRRAT Where the liquor at Sippin 'gnac
Bad bitch and a vicious track, I rel idid ax
Slide Pro Tools to both, so smooth I coast to the West like where Crooked livin at
New York is a piggy back ride to the motherland, hold on brother man
On the other hand get down, I'm gutter fam
Gun butt you with the  Eagle  handle Cunningham
I don't wanna talk, I just wanna beef, I don't want a piece

Joe Budden
Uhh, insane what they call us
How you married to the game but you probably shouldn'ta came to the altar
Every bar like propane for the sawed off, you try to hang and they'll fault ya
Eminem, Mr. Porter, Slaughter, my sentiments eminent torture, all of ya
Feminine marauders, they swim in that water
Men will assault ya,  Tommy 's and bats to resemble Lasorda
Kidnap your tremblin daughter, at least a quarter
I'm a menacin supporter, it's got a aura more like Sodom and Gomorrah
Normally somethin's wrong with me, blame on the quantity of the porn I see
And they pawns to me, when I fix the game y'all think shit came with a warranty
How the fuck they gonna stop what I was born to be Corner me, shit belong to me
Two choices, you can get along with me or sit your faggot ass right there in dormancy
Wait, all he missin is heels to be RuPaul, ain't nobody that's real ever knew y'all
Second to none and I'm dealin with bums 
who's time never comes, now deal with the blue balls
You ain't gotta fear me but you respect me, niggaz who never met me
threaten me, wanna Gillette me, comin to sword fight against a machete
Swingin spaghetti like it's heavy, some said he deserves an ESPY
In a Chevy like Andretti, put the desi where his chest be...

Crooked I
SLAUGHTERHOUSE

Royce Da 5'9
Yeah, Bad and Evil is BACK~

Uhh, we 'bout to get into a tale of a gunner that details the dungeon
Just as the pale moon illuminates the hail and thunderin
'01's the year where I fell from blunderin
Shady lifted his wing then I fell from under it
Now I'm free fallin, my career has gone into recallin
Regardless of who's fault I was speed ballin
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Then Marshall double backed and got me from on top of a hearse
I'm alive nigga
Justin T. ain't got nothin on me cause I done cried Mary J. Blige rivers
I realized that God's with us
Soon as I decided to put that bottle down and, pick up my Todd Bridges
The writin's on the wall   since niggaz seen me 
at the baseball game with Shady and Jay Z, suddenly everybody calls
Like, I'm just checkin on you dawg
While I throw up this message on the stall

When them bottles stop poppin and them dollars start stoppin
Do what you did to get it and don't stop don't, stop
I made a promise to my momma, I'ma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters don't stop don't, stop
I'm livin proof nigga, it's pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away don't, stop
It's the worldwide American way
I'm livin proof nigga don't, stop

Eminem
Your body language is sayin your confidence is gone
Well pick ya ass up lil' homie, come on
You just gon' sit there and take it or make 'em suck it
Tell 'em where to shove it
Straight up, you gon' make love to the world or you gon' FUCK it
The last time that life kicked me in the ass
I pulled down its pants and put a foot up its ass
Man what a catastrophe it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
and not open a can of whoop ass, let you pissants whoop me
would be the day I say I ate poop
Shit, the day that I don't straight shoot I'll drop out of my anti woman hate group
Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it, play it back and put it on straight loop
You haters look like you ate a grapefruit
You see me climbin back on that wagon, got my swagger back, I was draggin
Hopped back on it, grabbed the reigns on that bastard
and came back on 'em without remorse, man of course
I'm a one trick pony, cause I'll be screamin on these whores 'til I'm hoarse/horse

Royce Da 5'9
Nah, I ain't fadin yet
I'd rather stay and rap, I mighta made a debt
But I find excitement in wonderin what I'ma write next
so I don't stay in debt
Me broke You might as well cut the embryo out of my momma and play catch
with the baby with AK's with baby bayonets
I'ma get rich or I'ma die tryin
That's why it's either kill or be killed so call me suicide homicide Ryan

Eminem
There's a bomb inside my head, I'm a live wire
I am on the edge, teeterin on it like a totter, I might 
get on a nut like a tire iron; I have no desire stoppin
So why would I drop and roll That's how much on fire I AM
Rappers are fun and I'm the time cause I'm just flyin by 'em
And I'm laughin at 'em the entire time, why am I up
Cause tribulations I have triumphed, bitch I'm fired up
So one time for me just let your fuckin lighters light the SKY UP~

Eminem
Ohh Told you Game over

Royce Da 5'9
Uhh, Ryan's a homicidal misfit
I write the solution to biophysics on the side on a cliff in some heiroglyphics
This my admission to havin violent psychotic wit
Devour polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writin but I will stick this pencil in ya ass before I write ya shit
Pause, inhalin hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot, gas pedal push
Felons crooks, goin door to door like we sellin books
Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch dancer, I'm 'bout as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style you'd probably rip ya pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
it probably'll smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me anchor man, I hold down the ship
Leave you niggaz floatin in water then go and drown a fish
Fuck I'm fuckin heinous, I'll make you fuckin famous
Them lead showers is comin, fuck is you sayin

Eminem
FUCK, it's fuckin rainin; SHIT, it's lightning
BITCH, it's thunderin, cause I'm cussin up a storm if you wonderin
Shit, SHIT You couldn't muster up enough thought
to take a dump turd or brain fart, jump if you want
Urine in your face, all you had to do was say
that you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, Illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us just why it's gotta be
Cause we started out cold and it snowballed, we froze
Soon as we rolled up, on these hoes
Alls we is know y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fuckin the dog 'fore we start callin you Bizarre
Shit, screwed the pooch, y'all done raped the Pitbull
Fell in love with a Shih Tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
And as for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffin, fuck a ball sack if your taints can't take you on a date
You mistake me for a gentleman, you're 2000 and late
Man I'm will.i.AIN'T
I'm the bad guy, type of guy that'll drag five 
girls up on stage, pour ice in their pants, and the first one who  Peas , gets a  Black Eye 

Must be out of your mind
You think you're fuckin with us
Suck on these nuts
Bitch hang it up, this game is over

Puffin loosies watchin I Love Lucy with Gary Busey   crazy
How the fuck could you son me I'm Shady
Will there ever come a day where they could slay me
I don't know; fifth month, black and yellow insect, May bee/maybe
'Til then I kill the bad man tryna slay me
E'rything you kick weak, you speak kung fu gazi
All my homeboys, 2.0 boys
Nickel I just picked up a Phantom, look how it Rolls, Royce
Even if I wanted to quit I ain't got no choice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoists
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain mayne, so moist
Bang bang, bang bang House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write 'til my right arm vein's sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that YAOWA you know who finna file out
Definitively finish you, my fist stick out that agua
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Comin up never saw light but never lost sight

Joe Budden
Jets and movers, cesspool ers, meth abusers
Wish death to us, tecs rugers to respect they shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Must move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to nay hood, bigger than 'jects
Cheated death multiple times without riggin the deck
So I'm well prepped if you just want war
There'll be blood e'rywhere, you'd be layin on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, but keep actin like you don't know Mouse nigga
And you gon' need the best doctors, House nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light you'll be in the carpool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King starin at a picture of Obama's face
Talkin funds, niggaz ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

Crooked I
Take off, you invited inside of the mind of a psychotic rhymer
I'm kind of a   Dahmer
I'm grindin up rappers, I'm linin up jackers, I'm climbin up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun to split you to particles particles
Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's comin from
You stepped on #2, just to be #1
Now I'ma step on you, bring it to yo' yard
Bogart for ours, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

Yelawolf
I got Jim Beam in the liver, gettin head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jean zipper
But I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick Well BITCH you ain't seen sicker
Then I'll, crack and then I'll hop around in a hospital gown
Poppin the trunk, my pumper stay cockin the rounds
I shit logs and I piss, river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fuckin ignorant
Shit with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playin
Skinny ass, pants saggin, it's only yourself you're playin
Call me a clown but you love what the clown's sayin
in them freak shows at the county carnival, then you payin
Bitch I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark yellin Go Shady
Drivin slower than an old lady
In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grille, no Mercedes
I'm gettin paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would've broken most of you crazy
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lady
You ain't fuckin with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't wanna see the Crooked I, or listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap then homie I'll deploy
Game over

Marshall Yo I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
Yelawolf Game over
Marshall Ha ha

Eminem
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da duh duh da da, it ain't my fault
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get, off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
8 Mile Road And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
And go follow the footsteps I'm makin my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

Eminem
I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be bitchin holdin no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road

Eminem
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
if the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
from each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the verbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

Look.. if you had.. one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted.. in one moment
Would you capture it.. or just let it slip  Yo..

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's chokin, how Everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out, time's up, over   BLAOW
Snap back to reality, OHH   there goes gravity
OHH   there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't
Give up that easy nope, he won't have it
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so sad that he knows 
when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
back to the lab again, yo, this whole rap shit
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better   lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better   lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better..

Soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
close to post mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da dah

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
fact that I can't get by with my nine to
five and I can't provide the right type of
life for my family, cause man, these God damn
food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed plus, teeter totter
Caught up between bein a father and a primadonna
Baby momma drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot, another day of monotony
has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
to formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin option, failure's not
Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Eminem
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just, put it all into all I spit
Instead of always tryin to swallow it
Instead of starin at this wall and shit
While I sit writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't call it, shit
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall
if I have to see another one of mom's alcholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealin with another fuckin politic
I'm like a skillet bubblin until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin up
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough
My cup, runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think, all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peal the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps yea, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yea sit up, I'ma tell you who I be
I'ma make you hate me, cause you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
what you closed minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
out this world, ain't no one out there mind as me
You need piece of mind Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
to express how I'm really feelin at that time
Yea sometimes sometimes sometimes
It's just sometimes, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be
The clock strikes midnight, one two, then half past three
This half assed rhyme with this half assed piece of paper
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin
Fuck I'm stumped, but wait, here comes somethin
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid
Why am I a slave to this trade
Signed out of spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smits ain't a quitter
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a
fuckin boilin point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me and shake like a chainlink fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear their jaws was comin
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin someone
By the way they're runnin, you would swear the law was comin
It's now or never and tonight is all or nothin
Momma Jimmy keeps leavin on us, he said he'd be back
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest
I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch
I found my nitch, you gon' hear my voice
'Til you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung
If I had half a chance I'd grab it   Rabbit, run

Bizarre
The rap game, hip hop 101
The hardest nine to five you'll ever have
You can't learn this shit in no history book
You ready to rap motherfucker
You ready to sell your soul hahaha
The rap game will fuck you up

Swifty McVay
I'ma disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
You shoulda slayed me as a baby
Behavin' shadier than Wes Craven 
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me, punk it's over, you'll faint fast
I'm never fucked up to where I can't whoop ya ass
You'll neck'll get snapped with bare hands, fuck music
Is he rappin' It's cool but fools, just don't confuse it
What happens: these dudes get rude then I lose it
I'm scandalous, I blow ya two niggas off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back nigga
You are not realer, in fact you're feel the effects
Of a crack dealer, y'all presidents since he smacked
And got a mack 10 with it, so I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that, don't mistakin' me black
Cuz you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac

Eminem
I'ma get snuffed, cuz I ain't said enough to pipe down
I pipe down, when the White House just wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dike get sniped out
Now put that in ya little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute cuz the hype just died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfuck ducked, what the fuck son of a bitch
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade, with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword or sensai
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that utsl ay itchb ay
Ucks ay my ikcd ay, 'scuse my igp ay atinl ay
But uckf ay you igp ay

This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin' you, no it ain't happening

I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game

Kon Artist
I bet you'd rather me drink and drown in my own inequity
But fuck that I'ma rap 'til y'all all get sick of me
And clutch my nuts sack and spit all who pick at me
A pitt and rott mix, fuck the dogs you sic on me
I'm sayin' you motherfuckers don't know us, quit playin'
If I'm broke, then I'm breakin' up in the place where you layin'
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I look at this, why speak on when I want when I write
So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I bleed, take a piss and he stand
OK, you win, you can say we can't rap
But no Source never made me not buy an album when they say it was whack

Kuniva
This liquor makes me wanna blast the chrome
To let you know  The Time  without Morris Day and Jerome nigga
I'm low down and shifty, quickly call Swifty 
To do a drive by on the tenth speed with 50
Ya feelin' lucky Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chuckie Cheese
With ya seed, you be an unlucky G
My lifestyle is unstable, a partyin' addict
They said no fightin' in the club so I brought me a 'matic
Coughin' the static, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit
Poppin' the tablet and guns that saw you in half

Believe me, we run this rap shit, fo sheezy
Make makin' millions look easy
Everywhere you turn you see me, you hear me
Believe me, before you see my pistol in 3 D
No time to call a peace treaty
Dial 911 cuz you need the  police to help you believe me

Proof
I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, these street niggas twistin' my words
We finally could Say Goodbye to Hollywood
Cuz Proof and Shyne man shit nothin' in common
The nastiest band with gas in each hand
We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse, fuck ya stature dog
Nothin' to do with hands when I clap at y'all
Put your jaw on the ground with the four and the pound
Then I'm gone outta town 'fore the law come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats
Matter of fact, we can battle for plaques This rap game

Bizarre
I'm too fuckin' retarded
I don't give a fuck about my dick
That's why I'm datin' Lorraina Bobbet
My crew had an argument, who was the largest
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
Well I really didn't, but I did accordin' to this contract
I was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
Freezin' 20 below, forced to join Bel Biv Devoe
My little girl, she shouldn't listen to these lyrics
That's why I glued her headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
If rap don't work, I'm startin' a group with Garth Brooks
Hahahaha, 50 sing the hook

This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin' you, know it ain't happening

And I mean get faded, I mean get faded
Damn at four o'clock, I didn't almost make it
My barber's name is Sarah, she don't really know how to cut
But she gots nice teeth and big ol' butt
So two days a week, I get faded for no reason
Same ol' haircut, keep it low and breathin'
If you see me in a barbershop, go on and run
Cuz I'm probably gettin' a perm and my toe nails done

Proof   Kon Artis
Got here full grip, but can't call the cops
I gotta get the script from the lips to the barbershop
Jump in the seat Yo gimme the line and

Homeboy scooped up, in a new truck
Gave everybody a cup and gave me a few bucks
Then he started braggin' bout his last lick
Cut me a design along with his address

Eminem
Jumped out of the second floor of a record store with a Treacherous Four
cassette and a cassette recorder in Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis of a legend growin like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and, hence the origin of the Headless Horseman
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
Endless source and reservoir of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors and sexual torture
kits kept in a separate storage bin, excellent boyfriend
Use intercourse to settle scores with women who have vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in, 'til there's shredded foreskin
Reddish torn and they're only bein fed a portion
Bed sores and sore shins, pregnant whores can, get abortions
Fetish for stickin metal forks in, self absorption
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I  make up  for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus, yes of course
A mess of warrants, you want some Come and get some boys
I'm givin Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
on excessive force and pressure points
And dressin George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
dress and four inch heels to address the court
with a bull's eye on his back, his whole chest and torso
are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him
In my present form I'm Desert Storm
Appetite for destruction there's no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible; hello gorgeous
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said When you wanna get sexual
She said However I fit in your schedule, I'm flexible
Expired tags on the Saturn, got Catherine Bach
in the back in  Daisy Dukes  with the hazards on, at a traffic stop
gettin harassed, sign an autograph for this asshole cop's
daughter, laugh cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin back with it and got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock
One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack front axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff
Pulled tabasco sauce out of my satchel, knocked over a fisherman's tacklebox

That was fuckin stupid

You got it twisted, all cause I offered this bitch
a doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic
Bitch, get to massagin this dick
Like spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin list for you to run some odds and ends with
It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin dick on some suave and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at
bitches like fuckin missile launchers, misfit, blond and nitwit
Like I've gone ballistic with a frostin tip kit
Screamed I hate blondes and became one, I'm optimistic
Love to start shit, shovin Clark Kent's undergarments
in the glove compartment of the bucket, bumpin Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin up at Targets, trouble causer, double crosser
Shadiest motherfucker you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults, a
couple lawsuits, enough to cause a, stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results as, Rainman's is, somethin's off
But when Dustin Hoffman's dressin up in your mummy costume
on stage dancin to Brain Damage, what's the problem
Nothin's wrong the, name brand is, back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'ma dunk a bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap like an ACE bandage, don't give a fuck persona
To my last DNA strand, E&J in the waistband
At the VMAs with the stagehand, she wants kielbasa
Pre arrange an escape plan, three inch blade on point like a See and Say
Consider me a dangerous man but you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin
And that's what you wanted, a fuckin loose cannon who's blunt
with his hand on the button who doesn't have to answer to no one

Great idea~

If I was president, gettin off is
the first order of business once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's, walkin up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughing, dick cupped in hand
Screamin Fuck safe sex
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned   and make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static, addict who can't escape the habit
Continue to chase the dragon, but as fate would have it
I walked up in Major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man in a laser tag vest and a racin jacket
With a gauge to blast it and sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's crazy asses
in the back seat throwin Stayfree pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat, unfasten the safety latches
and slam on the brakes in traffic
so hard I snapped the relocation brackets
for the monster tires, finna get a murder case and catch it
like you threw it at me encased in plastic

And send Dylann Roof through the windshield
of the Benz until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin
Like a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula, you wanna go against 'zilla
The Rap God, when will I quit Never been realer
The instiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt whose pen's iller
than Prince in a chinchilla or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer, avenge syllable binge, fill a syringe 'til I
draw first blood, even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more, awkwarder, cause your innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Taught ya ta, not give a, slapstick, hockey puck
The broad hunter with the sawed off like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
But I'm not gonna get the shotgun or Glock, I'ma opt for the ox
Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I shop
and it's not a shock I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The Rock Hudson of rock cause who woulda thought this much of a cocksucker
to go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with the BOX cutter
... That was for 50
Little slap on the wrist be warned, I'm unravelin quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with, your time travelling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble   relapse into history
with a flask of the whiskey, tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeve's spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't havin to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me
is more of a spectacular mystery than a fuckin Agatha Christie CRIME novel

But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplatin rubbin shit in your face 'til I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
and never appear again if you actually had fuckin careers to END
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em
in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly I'm gone off you, man light some kush
You're my  First Take , I'll nail you, can't lie I gush
If I won you over you would be the grand prize, I'm entranced by your looks
Come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in the can like some Anheuser Busch
Jeans too small least three pant sizes, tush
mushed against your damn side, your puss and thighs are squished
What kind of attire's that I'm ready to be rode, psychopath
Bet you we'll/wheel get it poppin like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
Piper Chapmans might just have to pick et me, like a scab
Hard to describe in fact, startling violent perhaps
are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that, but as far as these lines I rap
and these bars wouldn't dial it back if I star 69'ed the TRACK

Why am I such a dick

G Eminem as Susan the girl
D Eminem as Dave
J Eminem as John

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl

Would you put it down you're startin to scare me
She said,

Hello I'm over here Sue, hi you're talkin to the plant, look

Cause I never seen no one eat as many shrooms as you ate

and It was an accident at the end

Susan wait  Where you goin  You better be careful
G Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue

I gotta go find Dave he majored in allergies
John, where's Dave at before I bash you
J He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude
Dave  Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants
choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left 
of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off
D Well it depends on how many pieces she ate
Just one, with double mushrooms by mistake
Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, breaking out in hives
D She's gonna die dude
I know and it's my fault
D My god

and What do I do at the end

My God, I'm so sorry

PHresher
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors
These bitches got flavors, they all wanna smoke but ain't doin no labor
But they shoppin at Raley's, they stingin like tasers, act Hollywood like they play for the Lakers
They fly on that latest, crocs, alligators, say hi to my haters
Pardon my neighbor we eatin, that chicken, lobster, potatoes; you must be sniffin that yayo

Fuck it man, I want the title I want the title submission, they goin all viral

Eminem
Bin Laden with a pen, body it again, I begin slaughterin your men, prolly shoulda been
Ali or the Svengali embodiment of sin like a Saudi in the Taliban plotting an event
in the lobby of the Intercontinental with an obvious intent and I will not even relent up on a little
Like Osama with a bomb under the bin inside the middle of the Pentagon and hit a kindergartener with a rental stop
Back and forth, back and forth, like Jack Kevorkian's ass to court
Rap mature, why can't you be like Macklemore Huh
Why you always gotta smack a whore Huh It's likely the psychiatric ward's a last resort huh
Somethin's gotta give, that's for sure, yet you keep comin back for more
Not as raw as I was, 'Walk on Water' sucks, bitch suck my dick
Y'all saw the tracklist and had a fit 'fore you heard it so you formed your verdict
while you sat with your arms crossed, did your little reaction videos and talked over songs chill
Naw dawg, y'all sayin I lost it, your fuckin marbles are gone wait a minute
But now a days, every flow, every cadence sound the same skrrt
Brain's a powder keg, I draw inspiration out of hate
Real pain in the paper, I don't trace, but if I look strange and out of place
It's cause I'm an alien, that's why I write 'til the page is outta SPACE
Yah From 7 Mile in Novara, to How can I be down All of us tryna pile in the car yeah
We shot for the stars yeah cause we only got so much time in this world yeah
So rewind it to your high school dance to the night before
if you think you're prom ised tomorrow yeah
Now I'm 'bout to fool again, this tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit
A freakin lunatic, a human computer chip, and I'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your Hooters chick
If I was you I wouldn't do nothin stupid due to the mood I'm in, I'm losin it, you get chewed like a Junior Mint
Show me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed, empty the lubricant and put super glue in it woo
How many fuckin rappers did I go through Dispel doubt, but you won't admit I smoked then you was spellbound
Hellbound in my snowsuit, but am I s'posed to, sound like everything else out
Cause I don't get compared to it, only myself now, and I can see the fair weather fans and sales down
But the only way I care is if I let myself down, but what the fuck have I woke to
Time to eat the vocals and shit out Pro Tools, I know you still want me to ill out, don't you
Hopin the old Slim's gonna spill out, open fire on your whole camp with this spit I wrote you
So chill out, no, you hoes couldn't roast me with the shit I wrote you
Then I took a stand, went at Tan Face and practically cut my motherfuckin fan base in half and STILL outsold you
You just called my shit trash, thank God, I rap better when the odds are stacked
Revival's wack, I don't like the 'Zombie' track, or when he's talking that garbage psychotic crap
Where's your content at What's with all the conscious rap Pnk, Beyonc� this, and Kehlani that yeah
I just add it to the fuel in my rocket pack 'til I'm ready to respond then I'ma launch it at 'em
Idiotic from the fuckin embryonic sac to the bodybag, I'll be back
And when I am I'll be at your fuckin throat like

PHresher

Psst... Hey, listen
I love my job, makes me feel like... Superman haha
Can you fly I can   wanna see

I.. am only entertainin' you, my
goal is to stimulate makin' you high
And take you and I to a place you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic so let me entertain you

I'm here to save you
I've come here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine

Eminem
My lyrical content is constantly under fire, no wonder why
Constantly bombed back to combat attacks to constant concepts
When lyrics are constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feelin' good when I should be ashamed
Shit I really shoulda fell but I stood, see I came
Like a flame in the night, like a ghost in the dark
There's a ray, there's a light, there's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set their differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe because

I am only entertainin' you
My goal is to stimulate makin' you high
And take you and I to a place you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic so let me entertain you

I'm here to save you
I've come here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine

Eminem
My music can be slightly amusin'
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious it might be confusin'
Tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it I get sick just tryin' to explain it
See I could sit and argue wit' you but it goes beyond
Just bein' a snot, pointy nosed, bleach blonde
'Cuz I came here to uplift, let your woes be gone
Tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly usin'
The Constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant
Let Me Entertain You like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone rebuildin'
World revolvin', still evolvin', still Slim
How many kids'll copy Probably millions
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby 'til then 'cuz

I am only entertainin' you
My goal is to stimulate makin' you high
And take you and I to a place you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic so let me entertain you

I'm here to save you
I've come here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine

Eminem
My lyrical content contains subject matter that sucks up all these fucked up
Young kids at an alarmin' rate, common denominate
Add it up, and you see just why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids emulate
and mimic every move you make, Slim, you great
But wait, can't you see I'm only hear to entertain
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cuz now I see it, feel it, live it but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced then pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy prolly tears you up inside as much
And as such, I pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust but

I am only entertainin' you
My goal is to stimulate makin' you high
And take you and I to a place you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic so let me entertain you

I'm here to save you
I've come here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine

Eminem Singing Backwards
I'm here to save you
I've come here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine

Oooh Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds, with a record of 17 rapes, 400
assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world, Slim Shady

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers Whose got the rubbers
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr Dre

They see that low rider go by there, like Oh my
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say I love LA
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl
Decisions, decisions garage looks like precision collision
Or maico beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's son who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts
They disgust, me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name n haters get murked
Bitches lust man they love me when I lay in the cut
Missed the cut the lady give a raidy some paper cut
Now picture us It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
It's elementary the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the same repetition is true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol The platinum dude is back on you hoes

It's sorta like pourin' Draino down a live volcano
You never know what'll happen next, it may blow
Same thing happens to the beats when Dre blows
I talk shit, but my dick's long as my payroll
I get ass like a ball player, but I'm a boss player
Pimpin' hoes from here to Australia
Till I get heart failure
Look at ya half of ya'll, all scared
Other half, hands up in the air, like Awww yeah
This is our year, this is what you call sheer talent,
But I think at this point it's just obvious
Fierce, they say my music's good for all queers
Cuz I make your ear ring, get it, piercin' all ears
Call us the mafia We got the fucking mob here
Gimme the hate and I'll feed off of ya's all year
Shit, I'm just doing my job here
You don't want no problem, do ya
Fuck it, I'll even crack a bottle for ya

Eminem
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, 'til I see what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently, you just bein hurt, this ain't gonna work
For me, it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
Cause we, are just gonna be, enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see, either of us
Comin to terms, where we can agree
There ain't gonna be, no reasonin, speakin wit me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speak a ingles
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin, unless
You're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
And you're gonna see, this gangster pee on himself
I see you D 12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely
I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seein you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
Come on bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too

Now go to sleep bitch
Die, motherfucker, die Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch what
Why are you still alive How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes
And go to sleep bitch what
Die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye
Go to sleep bitch what
Why are you still alive Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah...
...Go to sleep bitch

Obie Trice
We got you niggaz, nervous
On purpose, to hurt your focus, you'se not MC's, you'se worthless
You'se not them G's, you'se a circus, you'se no appeal, please
You'se curtains, you use words, cool heard, slurred in two thousand third
You'se purpin, you'se no threat, who's ya servin
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You'se not the streets, you'se the desk
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the debt

DMX
Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'ma stay blazin New York wit the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk wit my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet
Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin
But I'ma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy going with the same one that started the fight
He be knowing how dog get, when dog gon bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand champ, and my Blood Line is tight
Cuz it's all good, it's all right
Niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
Blood Line, and, we can go track for track
Damn dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that

Eminem
All you motherfuckers, take that
Here, take this too, bitch  Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Waaaaaahoo
We're killing all you motherfuckers dead, all of you
Fake ass gangsters No more press No more press
Rot, motherfuckers, rot Decay, in the dirt, bitch, in the motherfucking dirt
Die nameless, bitch, die nameless  No more fame
Ahhhhhhhhhh  Hahahaha
Yo X, come on man, Obie, let's go, haha

Proof
I put men on canvas

We call that the Hammer Dancers
That's the 3 5 7, now the feds want us
cause we lead dump and head hunters
Borough of every hood, in this crime life
My name painted on the block or this limelight
A G ain't nuthin' but a letter, you can hang, man
and these gang wars though out the gang lands
Got no problem with hurtin' a church
My model was murking 'em first

With no sea food, make 'em see through
I'm into slappin' niggas, next nigga

Swifty McVay
...Me too
My eliminations way too hasty, they don't chase me Uh huh

When the medal is sworn, label me the desolate one
It ain't no settlin' beef, I'm destined to come
to any hood, it ain't no justice, you wishin' it was
This crime life got me stealin' your goods
I'm a mental patient, on the way to the central station
Ain't no wastin' time and I'm sure I ain't facin' time
Breaker 1 9, the narcs be swarmim'

My lil' bro keep up the front like he the one that owe
By the time they figure out, I'll be dead and gone

Kuniva
Now be careful when you see them homies hop out that ride
How you can catch a body shot and knock your ribs out your side
and the cops are hesitant to come through these parts here
We head hunters, so it's evident that we spark fear
Token notes, but always give it to a person in need
of a serious chin checkin', and we're cursin' indeed
to get our point across, clearly ain't no misunderstandin'
Now there's nothin' you can do to keep these missles from landin'
When the hooligans come out, you should be runnin' for cover
By the time you recover from a hit, then here comes another
and you know our presence is felt like Christmas Eve
Make an example out of you, for her and his to see, boy

Bizarre
Come to your car window Yeah, you and your boys get out Get out

Zombie fire ya own family and make you verify
The corpses, had his horsemen and'll leave your stage torchin
Screamin Beat as soon as I show, ya niggaz fault then

I cut 'em off crooked in ganja green
Ya mans is high, get ignorant, or beats, by loosin his spleen
Your troop'll be seen as soon my team get on
We ruinin citys like Godzilla through Hong Kong
You ding dong dummys ain't dumb enough to try and dodge bullets
As soon as I pull it, I douse 'til you're full of it
I love beef, I'm mackin lit wit the heat
My technique is well spoken even when I don't speak
I sent a nigga twistin wit heat
so many times that when he knownful he facin the back of his feet

I'ma fall to those sworn, I split your capricorn
and forewarn your first born and forms a snow storm
I flip caps, like Kittins on gym mats and get under your skin fast
Battle me, I'm Slim , I crack brains like egg shells
and scramble your brain cells and shatter your veins well
The fatter the pains well hahaha
Who wanna jump, plainly rob with this pistol what
Step back, drew heat without heal like I was Sisqo
ahh Sicko, individual, from the get go uh huh
Stab you wit the pencil just to watch the blood trickle
Tickle you to death then I rhyme like Don Ripples hahahaha
Crack you in the back with an ax, I hide sickles AHHH
I got three dimes in my hands and three nickels uh huh
Leavin a bad taste ya mouth like sweet pickels haha
I'll ask to borrow ya car then drive through a police station
Jump out then start shootin like a bunch of crazed Haitians
Plus I'm too skinny cause my attitude is shitty
Plus my record label shifty, it's enough to make me pretty
what I'll make you mother hate me, you could place ya car bets
what Call me a vigilante like my man Benard 

The only things missin is for me to shatter these bastards
Cause I breathe toxic fumes and spit battery acid
and had to be a drastic
situation for you to step through the ghetto snort size gun powder
and pounce fortys and jet fumes, NECESS FUEL
We make the shit shake, to break the break
to tearin rappers out the brain, like ex bitches picture

I've climbed the highest mountain, once or twice but who's countin
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills

Eminem
Yo, yo
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve 
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit oops
Aww shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick and lost her foster kids ahh
This room make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
Everybody in the house doin mass amounts me
To the women in the thongs with they asses out oh
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D 12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is crashin out
Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out
Come on

Kon Artis and Kuniva
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs wrestlin Elton John
Heh, hey Von you see me steppin on these leprechauns
It gotta be Tums, the Exlaxe is gone
Ya I took them all dawg with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on
Yo stop actin stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new shit eww
Yeah I think I did too much uh huh
I think I got the runs uh huh

Eminem

That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other

Proof
Hop hills, hills I hop
Hop two hills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was  Incredible  and killed the  Hulk 
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes fall back and I'm scared for days
And when I'm, over weight and my golf ball broke
No okey doke, I'm packin my nose with soap
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Aww, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I'm payin child support.. it's your baby

Swifty McVay
I take fo' shots at one time
And I don't need a chaser when I'm swallowin' mine
Hey, you got any room In Bizarre's hatchback
We can't go far cause our car has flats
Why the hell you people think I rap
Because my mother taught me how to breach contracts
And if you got cash, then hide it soon
Swift, chill I'm just tryin to get bi like you eww
And I don't give a damn if they find me rude uh huh
Mean, crude, the hell with you too uh huh

Your mother, you fuckin faggot

La da da, da da da, da da repeated

Aiyo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we aint forget about you, you fuckin homo
We still remember

There once was a man who liked to jump around jump around
But he got too old to jump up and down up and down
so then what happened
So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up picked the guitar up
and then he what
Started singin the blues like there was no tommorrow was no tommorrow
come on Left his boys in the House of Pain the House of Pain
It was the wisest decision he ever made ever made
But the dumbest thing that he could ever do could ever do
Was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do now what you gonna do

chorus
Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago long ago
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

I remember back when you had The Knack had the knack
And I remember when you had your first heart attack heart attack
I was right there laughin when I heard the news heard the news
I just wish the cardiac would'a murdered you would'a murdered you
Damn Maybe Ice T's right, you are a bitch you are a bitch
maybe he's right
You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich
leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing that you could ever do that you could ever do
Was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do now what you gonna do

chorus

yo yo yo yo yo yo
Remember back in '94, like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When house of pain was out of fame like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again
Or even further back, when i first had heard The Knack
And you were down with Syndicate, I went to get your shit, man
I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound rediculous you dickless piece of shit,
How could you diss me, bitch
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude,
Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin, then you left the room 
and didn't say goodbye or nothin
Like you was mad that someone else was
White and tried to rhyme or somethin
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you 
I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me
Knowin I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me
Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin sing
And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
So everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you
And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues

chorusx2

You fuckin punk, pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy, fuck
And by the way, a 380's a fuckin sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin real gun
You little bitch
Next time say my fuckin name in a song
Don't be subliminal about it
You wanna fuckin diss me, diss me you fuckin faggot
You fuckin punk, pussy, you fuckin little bitch, fuckin cunt

Proof
Yo, aiyyo turn the heads up and the mics up
We got the Dreadknaughts, y'knahmsayin
Super MC, y'knahmean
Bugz, Dirty and all that, all that shit, y'knahmsayin
Desperados with the cars, Eminem

Eminem
Chauvinist pig, drove in this big Lincoln
till it went over the bridge, jumped out and dove in the ditch
Broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and a fridge
Kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids
I'ma go for your mids, here's a body blow for your ribs
while you're clutching your stomach and bleeding all over your bitch
I know where you live, your girl showed me your crib
Unless she told me a fib, then I'ma have both of ya did
Burning incense, facing a murder sentence
Under intense investigation for killing infants
while I sit in padded rooms doing shrooms
Having visions of dead pregnant women with brooms jabbed in they wombs
Slit your carpet and rugs and fuck your apartment up
Sticking it far with drugs, and jumping in garbage trucks
I'm from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps
Give you a kidney punch, and mug you to get me lunch
See me every summer laying up against the dumpster
with a hundred dollar jumper smothered in Southern Comfort
Got my Slim Shady sticker on your mother's bumper
She came home screaming, a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her

Proof
Aiyyo, proceed to list 'em, there's no need to diss 'em
Down here we heat 'em, destroy your whole breathing system
Twist 'em like beer caps once they hear that
Rap murder rates, and I snap vertebrates
Collapse further states, my track preserve the great
Your pack deserve a crate, in fact the word is fate
I kill you slow like AIDS infested nuts
I'm holding vendetta like seven great molested sluts
Calling me a bitch nigga, you need to stop
Reality, one on one, how many times you got dropped
I'm cutthroat when any track runs, conscious when I smack nuns
The rough method make Muslims run and pack guns
I'm volcanic, the sermon preacher
Burning emcees, most wanted by Herman Kiefer
You tried to get a squad, they was like Money, oh no
Leave you brain dead, hitting trees with Sonny Bono
I kick without a dojo, D12 slow flow
Shoot down your mothership and pimp smack mojo
No pro wanna go knuckle blades with the renegade
Nigga tried to go pop, and plus they minute made
My lieutenant sprayed your brigade and trampled your flow
Big P, the reason emcees cancelled they show
The truth will hurt, seeing Proof at work, no shame in it
The best part of your show is when you put my name in it
My squad be godly, fearing shit hardly
So I hope when I'ma die, dope like Chris Farley

Bugz
Fuck that~ Who run shit once these drums hit
You dove headfirst into some old dumb shit
Here's a can of asswhip, for you to come get
Yo' click made they trip, I make them hoes suck mint
Ask them girl, they know the scoop, don't fuck with Bugz bitch
I chop off her titty, have you sucking one tit
Them pink belly niggas, is who you run wit
Making half ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate yo' damn sound, don't like it one bit~
You could make a double album, won't have one hit
Your entire outfit, is on some bullshit
and there's not a damn one that I can't outwit
I ad mit, that my style is unfit
for momma's baby boy, because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit, larceny, give harm quick
You pull the alarm switch I stab you in your armpit
Now who the nitwit wanna come get wit
this egotistic Hip Hop fundamentalistic
Don't risk it, you get your shit split
Now keep your distance, and keep existence
I'm persistent when it comes to bent shit
I smoke a, blunt with my judge right before my sentence
I'm relentless, to deny is senseless
Yo' bitch paid my bill, that's where the hell yo' rent went
Fuck that~

Almighty Dreadknaughts #1
I kill competition, with no way out as an opposition
Execute the passengers on the flight, my executive decision
Then reminisce on how  Shady  the business
Terrorists asked by Iraelis when they visit
Bombing incentive, World War Three in the making
Murdered the exhibition, team finish~ Beat the ref senseless~
No timeout, extended play burns over your intermission
Then christen the battlefield with the blood of Christians
Crying for the messiah, but he don't listen
I pop my wig when I top the stove frame, boil sizzling
A pyromaniac cook, I do damage to kitchens
Fuck Home Depot, I demolition
when I home improve, you need Bob here to  fix it 
Fuck school and supervision
Bit off of financial aid and smoked up my tuition
Only hang around rappers with explicit lyrics
and pistol grip punks for the beefing, do you wanna get heated

Almighty Dreadknaughts #2
I got a mind full of troubles, everything's in doubles
I buy my guns in couples, no time for placement fumbles
Cause emcees come and emcees go, with broke flow
Injured from head to toe, no fitter model, we full throttle
You stuck in low, incapable to master flow
Everything is tactical, living mathematical
I smash the flow, unleash and let go
I shit like lava, original designer
Married to marijuana since a minor
Making attempts to sink my battleship could get you bent like fibs, what
Applying death defying feats, maintain to keep my peace
Flow like the sea when I release these beats over concrete

Almighty Dreadknaughts #3
My presidented transition has taken place
as I express vocally on the M I C R O
Power he's cipher, not equality, I deal it
Lace the track and made it real, now I know my people feel it
Keep their heads bobbing and the emotionals sobbing
Plus a culture cipher after shows, hoes slobbing
knobs, love the fucking flavor of the icing
Plus I'm precise and, my double edge continue slicing

Eminem
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they askin me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care
Doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
Yeah, I say it now and you can't hear me
What the fuck good does that do me now But somehow I know you're near me
Your presence; oh I went and dropped some presents off for Easter
to them, two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their
minds a little and dawg you'll never believe this
But Sharonda, actually talks to me now, Jesus
And everyone else is just tryin to pick up the pieces
Man how could you touch so many fuckin lives and just leave us
They say grievance has its way of affectin everyone different
If it's, true, how the fuck I'm 'sposed to get over you
Difficult as it sounds...

Eminem
Yo, yeah
Doody   that's what we called each other
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's, skin colors
'Til one day we was walkin up the block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees, I was catchin a sunburn
Tryin to walk under the trees just to get me some comfort
I'm moanin, I just wanna get home and I look over
and your shirt is off, I'm like You're gonna fry; you're like, No I won't I'm
Black stupid And Black people they got melatonin
in their skin, we don't burn Meanwhile my face is glowin
And I feel like I'm on fire, and the entire time you're just laughin at me
And snappin at me with your shirt bastard
And I have to get you back for that shit
And by the way them playboy rings my mother stole from you
Well Nate finally got 'em back, shit
That musta been at least 16 years ago, well I put 'em in your cask oww
Movin past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City Motown, hip hop vet
Hip Hop Shop dreads, it don't stop there
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds...

Eminem
Yeah, and this may sound a little strange but I'ma tell it
I found a jacket that you left at my wedding, I picked it to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass and
hang it up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all of me and D12, we feel like Fuck rap
It feels like our general just fuckin died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed, our two ways
are in the trash so some cats'll have to find a new way
And I know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here, and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressin on
Don't ever give up the dream dawg, I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you brought people together 
who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peace maker Doody, I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin
If it had to happen it had to happen   believe me
I know you're the one who taught me to throw dem 'bows back on Dresden
From eggin cars to paintballin, gettin arrested
to sittin across from each other in cells laughin and jestin
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court
so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin
Me, you and   what's his face I forgot his fuckin name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed 
our team and if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fuckin face
and that's on Hailie Jade, Whitney Lane, and Alaina's name
I'll let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot
in the air for you and pour some liquor out
with Obie in the parkin lot, of 54 just before
we were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more
Difficult as it sounds...

Yo yo yo yo yo this is
This is my motherfucking anthem hip hop
To hip hop music anthem
Cause I'm gonna keep doing hip hop music
until the day that I die aight bitch

Yo I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and ugji boards
Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holding a rifle, with a life full of drama like Tupac's
Jumping off roof tops drunk after i do shots
Landing in someone's backyard getting chewed up by two rotts
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizza's, now i got twelve visa's
So tell jesus I'm gonna quit sending when hell freezes

chorus
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over

Yo I use to be to heavy in that cruising rap shit crap
I think i fucked my head up listing to acid rap
I go to party's bumping nasty nas's new song
And smoke pot till I get high and i stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced aint, it taste tainted
Your whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like sci fi t.v
Fuck ICP buy my cd
cause while I'm screaming while I'm handing out promo tapes of my debut
telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you
Aint no shame in my game I turn the party out
Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

chorus
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
But as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over

Frontin you when I'm wit this
Let me refreshin you niggaz til you my position in this
Beef   Leavin you under Venice, opposition finished
There it is, we invaded created a Pyramid  
of a Haven of names, so blame Dre, and that ear of his
And I never HEAT you for respect, unless you GREET me wit less
I got a skunk, in my trunk
I'm lyin, I got a pump in my trunk
Your dyin, how many lumps niggaz want
Who's ready for y'all We ready for y'all
We too incredibly raw, for any artist that said he would draw
I stand firm, and it hurts to live it
You open that can of worms, I hope you ready for the dirt that's wit it
Slap a hoe, snatch a mic
Bein brought to y'all in black and in white

Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
Cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin his music to steer it, sharin his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference   they're sayin you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America
as a motherfuckin drug addict   like you didn't experiment
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrased
And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin do gooders   too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
Ha ha And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go   he's Royce, he's the King Of Detroit
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss My Ass it's just the

I determine what time it's on, I call my nigga Proof
Hand him a pint of Limon and turn him loose
I'm tired of you new jacks
I'm tired of niggaz that's like   I'm bout to blow
Unless you a bitch, we dont care if you bout do that
Move back, youngster, the glock on speak
Chew up your vest and turn your chest hair to taco meat
The street, continuous to pit, quick to smash ya
or flash the clip, or give you the picture developin
Click clock, six shots blows through another door
And it gets hot, Hip Hop portable tug of war
Who did ya niggaz beats you bitches, who made it work
Just when I thought my dogg couldn't get any meaner
You talk about his daughter, you probably gettin the heater
You talk about his momma, he won't even give ya the finger
He's crazy Deranged, not media eaters, we renegades  

Eminem
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and Satan a scatter brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter   a gateway to escape
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin Dixie
while I'm wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
in holy water   no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin spiteful, DELIGHTFUL eyeful
The new Ice Cube   motherfuckers HATE to like you
What did I do huh I'm just a kid from the gutter
makin this butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a muh'fuckin

I'll leave your blueprints covered in shoe prints
Poppin' Nuprin
Neighborhood nuisance
Murder your family for two cent
Makin' your crew tense
Brain's too dense
Leave the mic with two dents
Fresher than a whole mouth full of chewed mints
Givin' you rude hints
Cause if you're wack I'm gonna tell ya
I got the issue where they diss in next month's Source I'm gonna mail ya
You're a failure
You're style's staler than a bowl of hardened rice
Scared and sliced
I flunked kinder garden twice
But you ain't hard and nice
And you sure ain't servin' no bids
Sayin' you did is like seein' a damn virgin with kids
Creepin' like a phantom
Holdin' my dick like the  Player's Anthem 
Holdin' this microphone for ransom
Bitches ask me why do I talk nasty
Grab an ass of every trashy whore that walks past me
My crew's on drugs, lookin' like zombies
Smokin' bomb trees
Racin' police and dodge 

Royce Da 5'9
Lock, cock and explode
Way beyond bitin' a nigga
Get hungry, disconnect my jaw and swallow you whole
I'm probably gonna blow
Go to hell holdin' a mil
Street smart, under educated, over skilled
I'm tight to the vest
You wanna rip me off Then try
I fight to the death, who wanna piss me off, then die
Curse niggas that try, I'm the first nigga to bust
You the second nigga to pull, and the first nigga to die
How dare you think that you gleam like the rest of my team
You a bitch, you like a chip off a berget in my ring
Stick to my words, so I don't threaten niggas no more
If I make you a promise, then it's safe to say that it's honest
My guns is tired from being fired
While yours sits on the shelf
I'm like a song concept in itself
Totin' my weapon, burnin' your vest
In '99, wack niggas learn from the best and hope to be second
Nigga
Kool Kid nigga
What

People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it

Eminem
Hand me an .8, beam me up and land me in space 
I'm more than ill
Human horror film
but with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin, makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award 
for the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
and a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might get sent up back strike in a Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for
Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank 
looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off
No shit I'm a great danger to my health 
Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself

People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it

Eminem
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Sr.
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I laugh at the sight of death
and land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now

People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it

Eminem
My laser disc gon' make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face 
and place the clip and cock it back
and let it go until your brains are rippin out 
your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a Role Model, I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was paid to make me dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scott's
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that Just the Two of Us would make you hate me this much
And Just the Two of Us, that ain't got shit to do with us 
and our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch

Some people ask me, where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
And play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted, and try to play me
First I'll come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy
Ask what I think, and I say maybe
I'll fly awayyyyy fly awayyyyy
It ain't nuttin in my way so I may as well fly awayyyyy fly awayyyyy
It ain't nuttin else to say so I may as well fly awayyyyy fly awayyyyy
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon' die todayyyyy die todayyyyy
Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go go
And the only way to see me is if you lookin up from down below down below
And there's nuttin else to say so I may as well fly awayyyyy yea yeah ye e e eah
And there's nuttin in my way so I may as well fly awayyyyy yea yeah ye e e eah
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away, ay ay, ay ay, ay ay, ay ay
Yeah

Eminem
Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I'ma step up on the stage now, I'm gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hangin off of my butt
And you ain't 'bout to tell me nothin boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don't stink, I don't think so
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll
Are you ready now Here we go
The bald eagle has landed
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leavin you stranded
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands it's
Play Doh, I ain't back to play though
They said he died in a fatal, car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car, the white trash star
I fuck an RV up like Brett Favre
Homie you got it backwards, you're dippin your soup inside your crackers
I can carry rap 'til my back hurts
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractors
Get my back right, then I'm right back on you bastards
I was chasin a dragon, I don't know what happened
It's like that feelin I had when I first started rappin
I just couldn't seem to get back and recapture, that magic
So I went back to the lab, that's where I been at when

Just Blaze
I'll fly awayyyyy fly awayyyyy
It ain't nuttin in my way so I may as well fly awayyyyy fly awayyyyy
It ain't nuttin else to say so I may as well fly away, ay ay, ay ay, ay ay, ay ay
Yeah

Eminem
I took a hiatus haters, now I'm back to cause trouble
Got the fuckin shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
won't even give you cough drops for coughs cocksucker
You think you hot You ain't even lukewarm
My puke's hotter than you, you're soft, I use fire to cool me off
I told 'em I'd grow up one day and show 'em
I'd be able to choke clouds, pick up lightnin bolts and throw 'em
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgie Porgie kissed the girls, make the girls cry for him
Make 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn
Swoon over my sweat towels, it's mind blowin
Yes I'm livin the dream homie, can't nothin compare
I'm so up, I'm stuck in mid air, I'm lovin it yeah
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stair/stare
These haters are so pussy they're afraid to be scared
This is payback, like I owe 'em back pay
They spat in my face, now I'm back to do them the same exact WAY
And leave this rap game with a bad taste
And slap it back out before I step back out of this crap, they
slap me now I'm slappin 'em back, hey
Fuck it we're slap happy, yeah okay now we're talkin some smack ay
And I ain't lookin back, in fact they
can stare at my ass crack, how's that for hindsight What the track say

Announcer
Welcome back, to the stage of history

Eminem
Yo.. Slim Shady
Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll..
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you eww
Battle  I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse  
you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you 
Bitch I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal 
I ain't tryin to shoot you, 
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass 
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers ahhh
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it 
while I sit back and just hope it catches 
Blow you to fragments
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes

I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step, it gets dim
Tell me is this hell we're livin in
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

J Black
Am I the worst  Because I, never go to church never
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
Now if I pray everynight night
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight
You feel me God  I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a North Face
Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at

Announcer
Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle, fight

Masta Ace
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care

J Black
But every time I take a step, it gets dim..
Tell me is this hell we're livin in
Haha..

Announcer
Time's up
You lose

Meet Eddie, twenty three years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
he decides to rob a liquor store.
I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play...

Dr. Dre
Alright, stop Huh
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence But who are you

Eminem
That's nonsense
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with an aged razor blade

Dr. Dre
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighbourhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns

Eminem
Can you afford to blow this pit Are you that rich
Why you care if you scare her to death Are you that chick

Dr. Dre
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it You're right
Not over this list

Eminem
Stop

Dr. Dre
Drop the biscuit I will
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you

Eminem
You know what Dre I don't like your attitude

Sung
These voices, these voices
I hear them hear them, hear them, hear them
I'll follow
I'll follow
I'll follow
I'll follow all these voices

Anouncer
Meet Stan, twenty one years old.
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play.

Eminem
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
and smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little chicken's earlobe

Dr. Dre
Yo This girl's only fifteen years old
How could you take advantage of her
She's passed out

Eminem
It's easy, just cut these lights out
That's how
Then pick this chicken up
Get her off Brad's couch
And leave her on the front porch
At her mum and dad's house

Dr. Dre
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids

Eminem
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest Doobiest

Dr Dre
Do you wanna get hauled off to jail

Eminem
Funk that, drop her off, ring the door bell then bail.

Sung
These voices, these voices
I hear them hear them, hear them, hear them
I'll follow
I'll follow
I'll follow
I'll follow all these voices

Anouncer
Meet Grady, a twenty nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
he walks in the door of his trailer park home
to find his wife in bed with another man.

Dr. Dre
Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'

Eminem
Start breathin'
Man, you just caught your wife cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off
Forget gettin' divorced
CUT THIS CHICKEN'S HEAD OFF

Dr. Dre
Wait What if there's a good explanation for this

Eminem

Dr. Dre
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy

Eminem
Okay Thought about it, still wanna grab her
Kick her out the house, get your daughter and kidnap her
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped DEE BARNES

Dr. Dre
What'chu say

Eminem
What's wrong Didn't think I'd remember

Dr. Dre
I'ma kill you, you little mother...

EminemInterupting
Uhhh aahh Temper temper
Mr. Dre Mr. N.W.A.
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton 'n' y'all better make way
How in the hell you gonna tell this man not to be violent

Dr. Dre
'Cause he don't need to go the same rap that I went
What am I sayin Do 'em both Grady, where's your gun at

Yeah, Shady Woo
Haha, 50 Cent
G G G G G G UNIT
Em: Here we go again, yeah
Uh huh, hahaha
Does it make you mad, when I switch my flow
You can't understand, how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire, 'cause Shady said so
Em: HERE WE GO I'm on fire

Everybody's in a rush, to try and get the throne
I just get on the track, and try to set the tone
I ain't tryna use nobody, as a stepping stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off, just left alone
And I ain't even tryna go there, with record sales
I'm just tryna keep it humble, and respect myself
Say what up, keep stepping, and just rep D 12
Keep my nose clean and stay away from, weapons, jail
And living reckless, but if you gon' check my belt
You may see something else, I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Ruger, and deflect its shells
And send 'em back at you, faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops, that'll legally pop you
And I den seen a lotta people, cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja, must have lost his mind
That ex, got him thinking he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you, X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Just keep singing the same song, recycled
We all much rather get along, than fight you
Me and Halie dance to ya songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy will bite you
I hurt ya pride dog, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, wit syllable after
Syllable I'll just slap ya, killin you faster
Then you popin' pill after, little pill of them tabs of
That shit you're on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns, we could charge harder than Busta
We bump heads, wit any motherfucka that wants ta
So what's the, deal, what's with all the tough talk
When I walked up to you, like Ja, what up dog
How come you didn't say, you had a problem then
When you were standing there with all ya men
We could have solved it then, I'm a grown man dog, come holla
All you did was laugh then, smile and swallow
Another one of those little ex pills, in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything, that you wanna be, come on

I, know, you don't want it wit me
You, know, you don't want it wit me
You, talk, but soon we gon' see
You, don't wanna bump heads with me

Em: TONY YAYO You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja you Stuard Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week, I'm buying a new pistol
I clap at yo ass, wit this chrome .38
And put six through ya hats, that's seven and 3 8
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you shook night
I put my knife in ya wind pipe, you bleed on the turnpike

They see me pop up on icey, cause I could
You den lost yo money, prolly forgot yo way around the hood hood
Cause when you paranoid, it's hard to make good songs

Nigga please, stick to the script

Fuckin old ass ignorant innocent lookin senior citizen
Built up slap you like Grandmas all sensitive
Wait a minute hold on what's up

With those short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggaz could scream holla and curse
Go ahead, respond and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

Slim didn't send Proof to get into  Wankstas 
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up Gotti and this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stuckin your Bridgestones
What's wrong Didn't think we strong with real niggaz
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept bitch
When the talk get nonsense to walk in bomb threats
Contacts was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threatin at the boss you gonna see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggaz heard and they ain't scurred to bust

Yo, props to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster get jabbed in the tonsils with dicks
So much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya
Cadillac Pac or the transvestite that dressed like a Lil' Kim fox
Your chest like a little wooden box
When I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right all the little shit you got left to help you eat
Your not Pac's souls, without laws we'll help you sleep
You got shot in your video tryin to mock Pac

Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again

Ohh...
Ohh...
I said, ohh...
I said, ohh...

I said, man...
Damn...
Oh...
Damn, it feels good to be back
I'm having a relapse

How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges
He's already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem
Well to be honest, the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They compel me to kill this elderly man and I get these panic attacks
Pop a Xanax, relax
Trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass
Then I get manic depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed; man it's kick ass
The first thing I put on is the mask

Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of pace
And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you face
And slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
That's bacon souffle you making, ain't you
Well, thank you, Jason
There goes one more coma, due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more soma, and I'll be done for mama
Go in the damn, broom closet, another Valium, lost it
Shoving the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet

It seems like everyday I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that eighteen month old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a, second to choke his trachea
Breaking his neck in eighty some places
Baby, here Shady comes, lady
He's got the razor b blades and the ch ch chainsa saw, baby
You b b blundering, bumbling, m m mumbling dum dums
Yeah, here I come, come, you hear the rumbling vrumm vrumm

There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum, drum
A head and torso of someone, where'd it come from
Whose it belong to Maybe the girl with the long, blond
Hair who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms
Clearly there's som'n wrong, 'cause she didn't come home
She's missing; where is she Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now everybody get your dance on to my damn song

C'mon...

You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up

You done
Fuckin beard's weird

Gotta wake up Labor Day to this The fuck
Bein rich shamed by some prick usin my name for clickbait in a state of bliss
cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah bitch, pop champagne to this
Pop It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was 3 foot 11 you'd look up to me and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified, this motherfuckin shit is like Rambo
when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin  Machine Gun  when it's out of ammo
Had enough of this tatted up mumble rapper, how the fuck can him and I battle
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
Cause he knows long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see you're fuckin salty
cause Young Gerald's balls deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or, a love letter
Little white toothpick
thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you prick
Thanks for dissing me, now I had an excuse on the mic to write Not Alike
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin the fight you picked
Who else, want it Kell's
attempt, fails; Budden L's
Fuckin, nails
in these, coffins as soft as, Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But Kells, the day you put out a hit's
the day Diddy admits that he put the hit out that got 'Pac kill ah
I'm sick of you bein wack and still usin that motherfuckin Auto Tune
So let's talk about it let's talk about it
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth, need to get the cock up out it
before we can even talk about it talk about it
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings, just cause you look in the mirror and think
that you're Marshall Mathers Marshall Mathers
don't mean you are and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it
You fuckin..

Oh, and I'm just playin Diddy
You know I love you

Eminem
Ballz, Ballz, Ballz
Ballz, Ballz, Ballz
You'll never touch my...

Catch me if you can but you ain't man enough
You're standin' tough
But you know that no matter what
You'll never get the chance to touch
My ballz, ballz, ballz
Ballz, ballz, ballz
You'll never touch my ballz

Swift
I see you ain't a playa, you ain't ballin'
And I don't even care who the hell you call in
In this game, it ain't no talkin'
You can get it started, I nail the coffin
And all I here is get your man up off him
So why I gotta stop it, this nigga was talkin'
And I ain't gotta prove you nothin'
I do it and you ain't gotta push my buttons

Bizarre
This dude in front of me, he weighs a brick
He's quick and I can't get Marshall hit
So I played my position and don't make a move
Been doin' this for years, my team we can't lose
And ain't nobody, ain't nobody hard
9 o'clock, I'm gonna punch me a guard
Hut one, hut two, I'm ready
Hike, give the ball to Nelly
And nobody out there feels me
Take this 'fore you have to kill me
And any player in my way, I'm foldin'
Damn it, call holdin'

Eminem
Football, Football, I love football
Yes, tres, dos, uno
Dos, tres, fuck, shit, bitch, asshole son of a bitch
Everybody cuddle, blah I mean huddle
I just stepped in a mud puddle, butthole
Freak, who just tapped on my ass cheek
Nevermind, let's try quarterback sneak
Cover me, smother me with love that's brotherly
That didn't work, try another play
Hut one, hut two, hut hut hurry up
I'm reachin' up another grown man's butt
Hike the ball, I mean I like Bizarre
But Jesus, he hikes, I think I can feel his balls
My dick is long as it is hard, yeah so are my balls
It's the longest yard, whoops that's not the chorus
Run it back, wrong song, yeah disreguard
That whole statement I just made, what yard line we on
Our own 5 and our timeouts are gone
Less than a minute left, I just throw my ball
To the sideline to Von, he steps outta bounds
48 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts
Call another huddle, we're down by six
The plan is, to throw the ball to Swift
But he's so god dang high, that he's trips
Falls and slips, Proof grabs him by his fingertips
And runs the ball all the way down to the one
But he don't get in, but all we need is a put 
But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten
God dammit I'ma slap somebody if I get tapped on the ass again
Everybody's laughin' now, no timeouts and its now fourth now
We're never gonna make it, wait I just got an idea
Quick, everybody get naked, Denaun go long
I'ma throw the bomb, c'mon how they gonna tackle you with no pants on
Ass out with a floppin' schlong, touchdown yeah I told you
It's the longest yard

Kuniva
The new face on the yard, just hand me the ball
I'ma run through all of ya'll, ya'll just soft
Even though my cleats is kickin' up mud
It's more traction for me, I'm stiff armin' punks
High steppin' through the end zone
I been grown, I'm so dirty you don't even know my skin tone
It's time to rumble, no time to fumble
And I won't stumble, your frontline will tumble
Playin' ball with killas, my team's the realest
Three time offenders, even drug dealers
One of the best runnin' backs there never was
Movin' like Barry Sanders, leavin' you in the dust

Proof
Yak is high, I got the highest yak
Hit the ground so hard I leave tire tracks
Bizarre snap like a fire crack
And my palm more stickier than spider back
Eyin' my eye, a Mack truck tryin to sack us
No matter how big they flyin' backwards
Wide reciever, recievin' wide
For every stride in my life, yo I breathe and die

Kon Artis
Defense is playin' a pass
Then the quarterback peeps and screams blue 43
That means that its time for me
To run out the back like a bat straight outta hell
My tracks burn turf when they excell
I try to lateral pass the ball to Proof
He got dropped and the ball came loose
And shot up like a flare, I gave the ball a stare
And use my lineman's shoulder as a chair
Now I'm flyin' through the air like a superhero
I can use this pose for a box of cereal
I'm no joke punk, I get my dinero
For bein' the best player on my team what
As soon as I hear the hut 1, 2, hut
I do one run, run, the screen go run run
Then I cut, spin around in the endzone touchdown
Then I do the ninety shuffle so

Eminem
Footballs
I'm talkin' about footballs dude

Eminem

Ay yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ay yo, this sing is for anyone, fuck it
Just shut up and listen

Eminem
I sit back with this pack of zig zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensing these sentences
Getting this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully, peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me, speak to me
I don't know you and no
I don't owe you a motherfucking thing
I'm not Mr. NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty, is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm lifting you 10 feet, lifting you 10 feet, in the air
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, of all you
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be it's just me

Marilyn Manson

Eminem
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant
And Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn ahh and the heroin
Where were the parents at  And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Havin this happenin,this happenin
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way, rap this way
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin and I have returned

Marilyn Manson

Eminem
I'm so sick and tired of bein admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on My Name Is
And pigeon holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at Rock & Roll stations
And I just do not got the patience, got the patience
To deal with these cocky caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk
With an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin
The same fucking questions, fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
Till I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out
Cause they driving me crazy, driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standin by it
No I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

All up in these clubs throwing up like I ain't got em' all
But that's just what you see when you see me hanging with Runyan nem

You ain't never round helping out but soldiers come to them
Runnin to them, wantin 30 niggaz long when
You call me to the door I told 'em leading all your friends
And then they talk behind my back again I'm back to doing smack again
I'll have another baby cause safe sex I ain't praticing
Logic by the sleezy sleeze being fake ain't being me
It's just your misconception of perception when you seeing me

Proof

Arrogant This might be true... smack your bitch   slightly rude
Running from the white and blue for blowing up a bible school

Nice of you to think I'm not, but I'm ill this is true
Poppin pill, shooting guns, going jail   I'll shit on you
Yes I'm  touch the wire, fuck and bust a nut in Mya
Kelly didn't touch that girl, then again I'm such a liar
This is me all day, you rubbing me the wrong way
Listen what the song say and pass the fucken Bombay

Andre is more Swift with gunplay, one day
I'm proof next I'm Harry techs I carry on the runway
It's necessary that my sex is very nongayHey

Swifty McVeigh
They like to know what I can do, they ain't got the slighest clue

You better be prepared for beef, we don't need a new recruit
We blow a hole inside a nigga bigger than a hulahoop
See I know the business who the hell you talking stupid to
Fuck you upfuck you have your face looking like a rubix cube
You can walk the hood with me we can take an acid break
All you gotta do is choose, tablet nigga have a drank
Dabble with it rob a bank, Man this shit and new to you
What the fuck you niggaz think I can shoot as Muslims too
Nigga hey, what about the pretty bitch you call your wife
I'ma hit it nigga I been sucking titties all my life
Stealing shit and starting fights pissing on yourlawns at night
We hard to get along with stay ornery like Dolamite
Nigga you can be polite, I don't talk to people right
And so does the rest of us, you hating us cause we alike

Bizarre
Hey boys and girls, taking drugs is real cool
Hanging out in the news acting like a damn fool
It's the big guy with the shower cap kicking sicks raps
Talking bout fucking kids in the ass crack
Nevermind Bizarre... you know he's on medication
Smoking weed, drinking brew   third grade education
All in your house, blunt in my mouth
Call you a bitch.. and pee on your spouse

Kuniva
Look, I don't like the chitter chatter that's for faggots if it mattered
Then I'd have to splatter rappers just for acting   target pratice
Time for action I'm Kuniva
The wet Vagina finder
So nevermind you rhyming chumps
You might see me behind the pump
And yes it damages I put niggaz in bandages
And yes I love my pistol like bizarre loves all his sandwiches
Business is strenuous you fucking with some geniuses
Some many people on my nuts I wonder how my penis is
Girls approach me with bodies like Venus and Serena esess
I turn 'em down my wife would kill me if she ever seen the shit
I mean the shit, I'm silly man, I'm smart, I'm really ignorant
I'm innocent and guilty at the same time, go and figure it

Hi  My name is.. what  My name is.. who
Hi  My name is.. huh  My name is.. what

Ahem.. excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class 
for one second

Eminem
Hi kids  Do you like violence  Yeah yeah yeah
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids  Uh huh
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did  Yeah yeah
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is  Huh
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight
but I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate  Ummmm..
And Dr. Dre said, Slim Shady you a basehead
Uh uhhh  So why's your face red  Man you wasted
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut  Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

Eminem
My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high
The only problem was my English teacher was a guy
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of paper  Owwwwwwww
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup  Wsssshhhhh...
Extraterrestrial, killin pedestrians
Rapin lesbians while they screamin: LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS
Ninety nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her  Oh thank you
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans  Aaahhhhhh
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph  Dude, can I get your autograph
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE'

Eminem
Stop the tape  This kid needs to be locked away  Get him
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I comin or goin  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka    dare me to drive  Go ahead
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk  hachhh too
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks  C'mere
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM  WAH  YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS  WAH
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
Put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head  BANG
I'm steamin mad  Arrrggghhh 
And by the way when you see my dad  Yeah
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

Hi  My name is.. what  My name is.. who
My name is..  Slim Shady
Hi  My name is.. huh  My name is.. what
My name is..  Slim Shady

Ahem.. excuse me
Can I have the attention of the class

Eminem
Hi kids  Do you like Primus  Yeah yeah
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids  Uh huh
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight
And Dr. Dre said, Slim Shady you a basehead
Uh uhhh  So why's your face red  Man you wasted
Well since age twelve, I've felt like a caged elf
who stayed to himself, in one space, chasin his tail blalblalblabla
Got ticked off and ripped Pamela Lee's lips off
Kissed em and said, I ain't know silicone was 'sposed to be this soft
I'm bout to pass out and crash, and fall in the grass
faster than a fat man who sat down too fast
C'mere lady  Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog
I don't give a damn, Dre sent me to tick the world off

Eminem
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high  Damn
Thanks a lot.. next semester, I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
and told him to change the grade on the paper  Now
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Served the bartender, then walked out with a tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin over pedestrians
in a spaceship while they're screamin at me: LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS
Ninety nine percent of my life I was lied to
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans  Aaahhhhhh
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph  Dude, can I get your autograph

Eminem
Stop the tape  This kid needs to be locked away  Get him
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I comin or goin  I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of Kool Aid    dare me to drive  Go ahead
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk  hachhh too
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
Put a bulleproof vest on and tap myself in the head  BANG
I'm steamin mad  Arrrggghhh 
And by the way when you see my dad  Yeah
Ask him if he bought a porno mag and seen my ad

It's murder she wrote it's murder she wrote
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked for her to be smoked

Eminem
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
the shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lamp in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin, clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description and sketches ya
then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin Freeze
But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest
Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin out
Pulled the Mac 10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut your yackin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin: Johnny, go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
and collided with an 80 year old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin TRUCE TRUCE
and surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me  It was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

Eminem
Sometimes I don't know what this world has come to, it's blowin up and
this whole country is goin nuts and the, NRA is, in our way
They're responsible for this whole production, they hold the strings to control the puppets
... And they threaten to take away donor bucks
So they know the government won't do nothin and no one's budgin, gun owners' clutchin
their loaded weapons, they love their guns more than our children
Shh, think another one just entered in our building
And we'll be

Kehlani
Ashes blowin in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin back and we're never gettin old
Cause the skies are black but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin what you're told
We're goin nowhere fast

Eminem
I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin me back, down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact, I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and, fast
Another terrorist, attacks, like a tariff, blows half
of Madison Square up, alas, we perish, in the blast
But that isn't scarin us, we pass knowin we're fearless
Cause we're just

Ashes blowin in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care we don't give a yeah no
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin back and we're never gettin old
Cause the skies are black but our heart's made of gold golden
Fuck doin what you're told what we're told
We're goin nowhere fast

Eminem
Fuck doin what you're told, act like a 2 year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways, for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin this rhyme, cause I'm a wake and you're mourning/morning
That's why I rise and I shine, like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot, I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
Cause some stuff that's awful, really don't mean nothin although
There's a lot of, shit I said in jest, that's tough to swallow
... But if at times my heart it seems
like it's in the wrong place, it's probably cause, it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves,  Speed  of life, avoid or veer or just steer
toward it, we're only lookin forward, but where we're goin, we have no idea
Nowhere to go but hysterical, it's gettin warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit, but I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch   War Machine
But you forced me in a corner, I'm sure to, have somethin for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture, gets more severe
Go to war with me you'll end up blew to Timbuktu, I'll send at you
a 10 ton nuke like Kim Jong Un and end up ruinin your Korea/career
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off That day'll never come
To the pine box bitch, fuck you I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does but, I'm not gonna sweat it cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked, and I'm on top, so everyone's just

Cause we're goin no, goin no, goin no
Goin no, goin no, goin nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin nowhere fast

Eminem   Kehlani
You can't, tell us nothin
Hard headed, and we're stubborn
So, one ear, and out the other
When we're young, we're young, we're young
On the run of our lives
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter, uh oh
On the run of our lives
No more tomorrows, we're done, we're done
And all we are is

Eminem
No matter what people say
I'm gon keep rappin this way
No matter what you may think
I'm gon keep doin my thing

Eminem
I'm almost as famous as fat bald men
Decided to write songs to teach Mouseketeers to sing
I stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
So she gets fifty years of bad luck crash
Causing terror to Christina Aguilera
When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara
Beware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants
Got a habit of holding Tylenol in his hands
Til it melts in his fuckin palms and dissolves in his glands
So who is it The fool who visit the playground
Wit two biscuits to lay down the school district
Get pistol whipped wit a Mauseburg
Wit a pistol grip and fed pitbulls shit
Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits
If I get too rich, I just get sued

Redman
Yo, I leave wit no injure, after I blow four in ya
One handstand on top of yo' ninja
Crash it, ERRRR Doc stir the madness
til y'all outta work like Tony Atlas
Walkin, cans in the laundry basket
America's most with the army after us
Fuck flossin, we take what's yours
A low fifteen like a ace in four
I'm outta work, but Doc laid them off
shit, the power's out The tape is off
Yo, you targeted from arsonists
Papermate pens filled wit arsenic
I got hoes that don't know what Prada is
Doc could shape up, touch your barber miss
Betty you wit a bloody blade
I turn rap camps into Crystal Lake
Fuck bitches face is what I'ma do
Cuz that's what Brian Boitano do

Eminem
So how is everybody doin tonight
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight
Cuz uh, we gettin down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this... Off the Wall

Redman
Yo, so how is everybody feelin tonight
Hope you're in the mood to get rude and ill in a fight
Cuz uh, we gettin down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you don't wanna bump... Off the Wall

Eminem
No matter what people say
I'm gon keep rappin this way
No matter what you may think
I'm gon keep doin my thing

Redman
Yo, you could buy Jaz spittin', hospital, son admit it
Rip your lips off, kiss my ass wit it
Slap bitches, got Marshall Mathers printin
Weed, X, and the acid tabs did it
I was happenin wit no rerun
Like Rob DeNiro when the  Heat  come
My barrel hang out the Camaro
Aimed at the nose of them hoes it's hard to breathe from
Flash the gat, your town, bogardin'
Yo' wallet, your chain the main target
Beef is like cold engine, don't start it
Bust in the air and hit a airplane pilot
We clowned you, rap surround sounds around you
From ten speed and brown shoe
Doc and Eminem, cock the M & M
Blood flows with 2Pacalypse and them

Eminem
It's like, Funk Doctor meets the punk rocker
Got the drugs stopped inside the lunch box uhh
Pop junk like I just got jumped
Popped the trunk and pulled out the shotgun pump
Knock wood, it's all good, thank God for Vodka
Cuz wit my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker
Probably got a fanatic waitin upstairs in the attic
Wit a automatic callin me up there
My man Stan wit a gat in his hand
Stakin my house out in a tan tinted Sedan
He pull your mouth out til you can't finish a damn
Ham sandwich, or your can spinach and Spam
Til you gotta sip through a straw, shoplift through the mall
Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
Hey ma, maybe I'll give you a call
Sike you fuckin bitch, suck a dick and two balls
I'm givin you all my job descrip'
Which is, to piss bitches and priests off with this
Pop more pills than police officers
Arrive at the scene and pull me off of Kim
Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls
But y'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all
Cuz I'm so goddamn off the wall
I might as well as be a painting smashed on the floor

Redman
So how is everybody feelin tonight
Hope you're in the mood to get rude and ill in a fight
Cuz uh, we gettin down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you don't wanna bump to this... Off the Wall

Eminem
So how's everybody doin tonight
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight
Cuz uh, we gettin down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this... Off the Wall

Eminem
No matter what people say
I'm gon keep rappin this way
No matter what you may think
I'm gon keep doin my thing
No matter what people say
I'm gon keep doin my thing
No matter... oh

Scratching:
No...you hear me You go to hell  > Mr. Garrison

Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Mom wouldn't take me
The bitch still hates me
Shit, one day she said, Go rake leaves, 
I said, Make me
I'm proud to announce I was probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house 
For making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on going
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, Please fix me
Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince
And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then
I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta this fake ass school and rhyme
Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
You fuckin' pricks

Scratching:

No...you hear me You go to hell  > Mr. Garrison

How the fuck you gonna fuck with O Trice with a staff full of hoes
With one gat and a wack stack of flows
A whole lot of lip
Thicker than Obie's shit
Oh shit they found your ass floatin' in the ocean
Body part corroded
Cast away
You stretched in a cast today
That's how a real bastard play
Do shit the bachelor way
Creek niggas will blast away
Y'all niggas ain't tough
Y'all niggas funny
Y'all need to roll on WB 20
Niggas think they 2Pacalypse Now
Until they catch a buckshot
Chicken pop a nigga's style
Niggas scared of the firm
Slim, Dirty Dozen and Trice
Come back like thieves in the night
Niggas jump, that's reason to fight
That's reason to rearrange your teeth with the right
Motherfucker

Hey them horns ain't extensions nigga listen
Real shit here
Haha
Face to face you got no heart
When I blow sparks you lean on me like Joe Clark
My mind is so dark
Its superficial
Nuclear Missile
Hit your body and your bones and I loose the grissle
Proofs official, D12 trademark
A man with no S big braveheart
Y'all ain't even listen
No S big backwards is Gibson
Mel Gibson bravehearted
Now on to my mission
And since then no failure
I promised God to commit hommicide to niggaz wantin a free ride
Like the Amistad
I'm alive
And just started Anger Management To Late by Lonnie Clive
Part of ya mind
Dyin' to rhyme
Like Ronnie and Cline
Influenced the greatest
Like Ronnie and Todd
It ain't no problem too hard
My solo like Do Lo
Been gettin' it
Like I ain't been shittin' it
CHORUS
Y'all done start it
Derty Harry
Contract mothafucker lets roll it right now
Y'all done start it
Derty Harry
You the one on this
Y'all done start it
Derty Harry
Proof nigga I'm a wolf
Y'all done start it
Derty Harry
You can get some now

In high school ofcourse I was the best in the lunchroom
Don't make me get up out my seat bitch
I'll punch you
I freestyle for fun but write for wealth
I'm so dope nigga even bite myself
I rap and will rappify you
Blast
And your just a baptist crier
and then add the black Messiah
We gat for hire
To let the techs growl
Put something in your body worse then the West Nile
I was born out of test tube glass
I suggest you blast nigga
Or catch sum flesh wound fast
I ain't met a man that can wrestle gats
I'm right behind the top rappers like a neptune track
Ya L.P.
I slept through that
Now guess who back
Unless you strapped with a vest and two gats
I suggest you pack
I'll spread you flat then rescue rap
Hit your body so much that your flash won't match
Mothafucker

CHORUS

Fuck Osama for bombing in the racing buildings
I'll bust him and hide him like Jason Williams
I heard Bizzare and D12 be raping children
Cut the hype dyke I'm trying to make a million
Take this pill then call me when you sober up
Turn the dyke from glad and soon I'll make them hold my nuts
Seldomly seen is Elvis the King
But it's Em thats got these kids nailed to the screen
I held the team
I F
I got something on my chest thats hard to digest
I heard the streets talking
Seen
Offering
I'm checking my weapon
They mad cause I'm flossing bling
I lost my steam but a demon in human flesh hyped my up
Now my team is tightly cut
So sugar sugar, shot shot
If you didn't get off it's not my fault
The dog is back and y'all niggaz

CHORUS

Ja Rule Sample
Its murdaaa... hahaha...its murda..

Word on the street is that I murda this Inc
Get whacked with the hands not deservin the heatin
There's nerves in this beef
To Irv and his peeps: I ain't rappin no mo'
I speak through the curves in the streets
Ya hit's, man, is weak
Ya did a poor job, that midget Cookie Monster be hangin' from a door knob
Ya lucky I don't like touchin women
And don't like no peace, talk somethin' with Russel Simons, WOOF
Got the right connections
My perception, ya know, would be beefin, ya life is definatly gone
The  singin' at least the Woof of rap
You'll need more than a Bush attack, don't push me back WOOF
You think it's just 50 and Sha, listen up Ja, no kids in the lobby in
Detroit city wishin you DIE
I know you just wanna rap and be Pac, but before its said and done

Yall don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like WOOF
PROOF, nigga, I'ma WOOF
I'ma about to getcha brain pushed BACK

CHRIS GOTTI
This nigga had the nerve to have ten niggaz sneak me just to get wit me
I'm only 160 and the fact is
I murder niggaz, DJs, and kittens
I only walk out with scratches, wearin a Rolex shirt
So if thats the streets, speakin ya dress don't hurt
You cowards do something before we do ours
I could write a Ja Rule album in two hours
Bleedin dead on ya back, have ya pockets flat like Federal Tax and
put ya head on the rack
I'm so bad, the only thing good is death
And L.A. G Unit posted and shook left, ha, bitch
I'm from Detroit with the hottest and hollas
Niggaz like 'yall garbage, don't even bother', haha
Plus ya overweight and gangstas is maddening
50 made Wanksta and the definition of wanksta is AINT TOUGH
With pictures of Ja in a braw with a paint brush, paintin his war marks
I'm losin my patience
It ain't just D12 and Obie, homey, cancel ya shows and show respect
like ya know me, hehe
It zones and its hailin a jet
911 style: to ya face to ya chest
911 style: to ya face to ya chest
It's over, nigga, gettin wet on the set, BLAU

Haha
I ain't even talkin no more
I can't believe my nig can write yo whole ass out, nigga
Whatcha talkin about 'that we gave ya the proof'
You scared to come in that club, nigga
You ain't got shit
I'ma tell you like this: Black Child, Chris Gotti, I'm on that ass
Cmon See You niggaz wanna be street niggaz
Who would you wanna recruit
Cause I'ma murd' all you soldiers and recruit ya bosses when this over
Big Proof D12 Only a one sixty three
I left out with scratches, nigga
Wait till y'all niggaz come to the D
Yeah, I'm goin to New York I just love Summer Jams
I'll be back fuckin with ya bitch
A'yo, Cookie Monster: come get me, nigga

Now don't make me write some real shit, nigga

Proof talking
This my last letter right here
Fuck this world, lets get the fuck outta here

Proof
I put my soul through the ink
Bless a path with thoughts at my thoughts
Before I grow extinct
My back bone disowned by zone
Why roam called home
But now on I'm all alone
Just Proof, no shine, no friends, just fans
No wonder my hands, tight where the Internet ends
I take back most of the flack
The stress smokes, press me close to the crack
Like my pops, the ghost of my past
Thyme and Mudd, Jay Dee and Stuckey
Lately I'm lucky, I don't hate me to touch me
Maybe I'm ugly inside, but smiling to make it
I love y'all dawg, and that's how ever you take it
The fame is an illusion, I'm still losing
In this game, with the rules and..
I feel clueless, the streets with the hills blue less
Cops knocking at the door, got me looking real foolish
But I still do this, like I love it, even though I thug it
Keep flossing lights in public, the subject y'all don't know
Stars won't grow, who would dream that scars would show
Minus the MTV videos with slim
Up in Smoke D 12, and many shows with Em
It's still me dawg, no change for change
It's strange, when it pours it rains
I take it back..

I wish I could take it back, I wish I could take it back
But it's too late
I wish I could take it back, I wish I could take it back
But it's too late

Proof
Always talking to Snuk hopin' he speak back
Wishin' my first son was here to reach at
Feeling detached
My brother Earl, and Wayne, that bail money for jail, y'all can keep  that
I've been deep before, ask Stillman
My hearts melting, tell the truth, I need help man
I hearts big but by sins bigger
Fuck the world, I don't feel like I can win niggaz
It's like I'm lost and I find only demons
I wanna quit, its like I'm tired of breathing
So my stress confess to a famous song
Em I love you, don't let this money change us dawg
1st Born, when I'm gone, grab the sign
Leave Naeem with the cream and his mom
And dear mamma, I use to hate you
Now I relate to, everything you did to make Proof
I love you..
Take it back

Proof
All y'all see is Free from 106 and Park
Y'all don't know I risk my heart with this apart
From the streets, the groups, the friends, the foes
The jewels, the dick lickers and the hoes
What about me
Sheltered with no guidance
Look at the finest, royal highness on some hot shit
Still living with the liquor and bud
Sometimes I wish for my demise, so I can kick it with Bugz
I wish it was real between us all
In the past, you should of seen us dawg
I die for Em and save Hailie, brave maybe
But just let them tears roll off my grave Shady
Kuniva n' Swift, how live does it get
I meant to teach y'all niggaz to survive in this bitch
If we die to be rich, that makes me happy
And on another note, shit, don't hate me pappy
It's just that we look the same, you let the game take you
Your son game along and took the game
Since I took my own life, y'all feel a killa fo sho
Bizarre on the real, you the realest nigga I know
Strapping and busting ain't real, just tell your mans the truth
And that's why you've always been friends with Proof
Answer to all, I've always lied with truth
And before I pull the trigger, Denaun, I'm proud of you..

Eminem
Yo.. I dedicate to this.. to yo..

To all my fans, keepin y'all in health
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself
Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart conditionin
which I create, cause that's my mission
So listen close, to what we say
because this type of fag claims to never be gay, I..

.. knew you was jealous from the day that I met you
I upset you, cause I get respect I pet you boy
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew c'mon
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you
Peckerwood mad cause his record went wood
No respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood
and said, Heck, country western rap records are good
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both haha
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year
then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere
It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year
No one's tryin to hear some fuckin old fart in a chair
sittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear
So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea
Figure you can diss me to jump start your career
I punch you in your fuckin chest 'til your heart kicks in gear bitch
And fuck your underground buddy's nameless crew
Like I'ma say they names so they can be famous too

You just a.. quitter, and you bitter cause I came along
and the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'ma kill you I'ma kill you

Eminem
Yo.. heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke
to the rap you wrote, your fuckin answer back's a joke
And I'ma tell these motherfuckin fans the truth
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you
You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you
like I ain't notice you  BITCH, I had a show to do
Like I'm supposed to be star struck, come over to you
You better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh for two
Back in ninety four Limp opened the show for you
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
Took your motherfuckin DJ and stole him too
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
Confused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick
Mr. Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap
quicker but never last, and Everlast is a..

Aight listen look
So this is what we ask of our fans
If you ever see Everlast, WHOOP HIS ASS
Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him
Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a hoe, bitch slap him
Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp
Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid
Do it for Ice T, do it just to do it, fuck it
He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin
Shit in five years we'll all be Eating at Whitey's
And he'll be bussin tables in that bitch, cleanin the toilets
Aiyyo.. fuck this, cut this shit off

Aiyyo Head, that's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker

Kill Whitey   Hahaha
Kill Whitey   Detroit  What  What
Kill Whitey   .. yo, yo
Kill Whitey   Haha  Look

First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay
You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White
So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight
Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford, forty and white, lethargic ass dickhead
I keep 'em comin while you runnin out of breath
Steady duckin while I'm punchin at your chest, you need to rest
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
with your three CD's, nobody sees, when they released
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MC's
who ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks
I let you faggots know it's on for life
but Everlast might die tonight, haha
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know

Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
but you 'bout to get relapsed any minute
Honkey, I hit 'em up

Hahaha, yo check this out
You faggots ain't even on my level
I'ma let D 12 ride on you bitch made ass faggots

Kon Artis
Yo  Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Whitey Ford's heart just stopped
Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack
Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin back
Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are
At your own restaraunt, while I'm servin ya
Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops
Call the cops, I'ma beat your ass while they watch

Kuniva
Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik
Where's your House of Pain now  There's only one of you Erik
You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round
with some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfuckin Belle Isle Bridge

Eminem
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
this ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin killed
with his chest open
Tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin
Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
cause you SUCK motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
Talkin 'bout you packin pistols but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale
on his way to fuckin prison, pistol whippin tail, ha
Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day
That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha
Now it's all about country, you gave up hip hop
Forty nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop
while my sales makin records break
Two and a half million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker I hit 'em up

Proof
I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave., where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music, we got an uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated you violated
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
Iriscience get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches get your throats cut

Swifty
What the fuck  Is you stupid
I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin guitar cord
and stuff him in cardboard, chopped up in a box
with sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart
D 12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaraunt locked and block your door
Cause we Hit 'Em Up like motherfuckin Tupac Shakur

Eminem
You a, Black Jesus, heart attack seizures
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
White devil, washed up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country

Yo, aiyyo cut this shit off

Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise
I just believe in kickin a man while he's down
God damn  I quit
Mention my daughter's name in a song again you fuckin punk
Aiyyo..

So let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this

The Invasion Invasion yeah
Green Lantern the infiltration, we comin' yeah

Bridge: Eminem
I got 50 Cent, I got G Unit
D Tweezy in this bitch, wit Obie Trice
So watch what you say, 'fore you call our name
Cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice

Whoa, here we go, I shoulda' known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later you little haters
Are too jealous of us to love us
You hate it G Unit made it and Obie's coming
D Tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach
50 percent of it's 50 cent
The other 50 percent of it's who's color of skin it is
But if you even considerin' taking our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it
I'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cause then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates to some other shit
Then I'm a flip, then I'm a get to
Stomping in my Air Force Ones
But you won't be able to tell 
If it's two pairs or it's one
It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
You'd think Nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink 
I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
Wit a pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggedy

We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D Tweezy, G Unit, 50, Shady records
We the label fa' sho

We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and steal your paper
Obie, D Tweezy, G Unit, 50, Shady records
We gon' kill your label fa' sho

Eminem
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to  Roc The Mic  right
Still watch what you say to me punk

Haha, Shady Records
Still Aftermath, and don't think we don't 
Hear you motherfuckers talkin'
Cause we do and we see y'all
We just gon' sit back for a minute 
While I see what the FUCK y'all do

will be made for this track to showcase Eminem's lyrical war with Benzino

Eminem
This motherfucker man
Just won't shut up will you
Talking 'bout I owe him...
Bitch you owe me... I'm promoting you right now
Yo let's put the nail in his coffin

I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear that grandfather rap nope
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that, so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignitay

Eminem
I would never claim to be no, Ray Benzino
An eighty three year old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me Ugh
Please don't you'll probably fall with me, and our asses'll both be history
But then again you'd finally get your wish
cause you'll be all over the street like 50 Cent Hahaha
FUCKIn punk pussy, FUCK YOU CHUMP
Give me a one on one; see if I don't FUCK YOU UP
Tryin to jump the Ruff Ryderz and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck, dick
In the industry, swear that you in the streets husslin'
You sit behind a fuckin desk at The Source butt kissin'
And beggin motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you can't even get the clearances, 'cuz real lyricists
Don't even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we don't like you we HATE YOU period
Talk about a mid life crisis, damn
Last week you was shaking Obie Trice's hand
Now he's a buster What the fucks with that
Get on a track dissing us and kissin 50's ass
And asking me what I know about indictments, bite me
Bitch I got two cases, and probation, FIGHT ME
What do I know about standing in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands
What you know about your wife slicing her wrists
Right in front of the only thing you have in this world A little girl
And I put that on her, when this is all o ver
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I don't know shit about no shopping rocks
But what you know about HipHop shops rocking spots
Where you the only white boy up in the bitch just rippin'
Pressing up your own flyers and your stickers, stickin'
Them bitches up after spending six hours at Kinko's
Just making copies of your covers to cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spending your whole paychecks at Disk Makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life
Oh that's right, you should know what that's like, you're half white
Hahaha Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
I'm eating you alive inside, Jesus Christ
If you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down
You should be out killin motherfuckers right now
Kill a motherfucker dead, KILL 'EM DEAD BITCH
Shoot 'em in the fuckin head, GO AHEAD BITCH
Slap my mom; slap THE FUCK OUT OF HER
She can't sue you; she wouldn't get a buck out of ya
'Cuz you're broke as fuck, YOU SUCK, you're a FUCKIn JOKE
If you was really sellin COKE with, then WHAT THE FUCK 
You STOP for, dummy If you slew some crack
You'd make a lot more money then you do from rap Hahaha
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what it's like to be rich; life's a bitch ain't it
Raymond Here let me break the shit down in Laymen's
Terms for you, just to make sure that you can understand it
Since Canibus is using too many complicated fuckin words for you
Here let me slow it down for so you could understand if I say it slower
... Let it go dogg, it's over

I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear that grandfather rap uh ugh
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that, so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignitay

Eminem
Haha... talking 'bout, I have motherfuckers calling your crib
BITCH YOU AIN'T EVEN GOT A FUCKIn CRIB
You ain't even got a fucking phone... fucking bum
Threatenin to shut me down at ya lil' fucking Source magazine
If I come back when did I attack you
BITCH you attacked me first take it like a man and shut the FUCK UP
Fuck your little magazine too
I don't need your little fucking magazine
I got XXL's number anyways...
and y'all can't stand it 'cuz they gettin bigger than y'all
Oh, and by the way... how'd I look on the VMA's
When you was watching me from whatever fuckin TV you was watching me from
From Boston...the mean streets of Boston
Fuckin sissy, and you got us scared up in that motherfucker
SUCK my motherfuckin dick 
Oh And for those that don't know
Don't get it twisted y'all
THE SOURCE HAS A WHITE OWNER

Eminem
It's all bad now man, it's all bad
Cuz y'all done FUCKED up now
YEA Ha ha, new shit, aiyyo
I just want the whole world to know
That I did not start this, but I will finish it

Comin' up, it never mattered what color you was
If you could spit, then you could spit
That's it, that's what it was
Back when, motherfuckers was straight backpackin'
Cipherin', fightin' for life in this rap
For the mic to get past, and you psyched and you gassed
Then you hype, cuz you last
And you might whoop some ass
If you lost, then you lost
Shake hands like a man and you swallowed it
When the Unsigned Hype column in The Source was like
Our only source of light
When the mics used to mean something, a four was like
You were the shit, now it's like the least you get
Three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
Four and a half or five
Means you're Biggie, Jigga, Nas, or Benzino
Shit I don't even think you realize
You're playing with motherfuckers' lives
I done watched Dre get fucked on The Chronic
Probably cuz I was on it
Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin breath to get a five
Shit I was right, I'da fuckin died already tryin
I swear to God, I never lie, I bet that's why
You let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit, we knew
You'd probably try and fuck us with Obie and 50 too
No more Source for street cred, them days is dead
Ray's got AK's to Dave Mays' head
Every issue there's an eight page Made Men spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid of this fuckin waste of lead
On my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple
So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This old G's about to get smoked like rolled weed
You don't know me or my motherfucking mother
You motherfucking punk
Put me on your fuckin cover just to sell your little
Sell out mag, I ain't mad, I feel bad
Here's an ad, here's a poster of Ray Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit that you don't know about, yea
Let's talk about how you're puttin your own son out there
To try to eat off him because you missed your boat
You're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old
No wonder you're sore now, lordy you're bored now
I'm pushing thirty, you're kickin forty's door down
Bitch this is war now, and you'll never beat me
All you do is cheat me out of Quotables
But you know that you'll always see me
On your TV, cuz you've got to stay up 'til
Three in the morning to see your video played once on BET
So, hee hee hee, who has the last laugh Aftermath, yea
So on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks
We'll never fold or hold back, just know that
Benzino's wack, no matter how many times I say his name
He'll never blow jack
You're better off tryin to bring RSO back
Look at your track record, that's how far it goes back
It's extortion, and Ray owns a Porsche and
So half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from Boston
Bullyin and bossin Dave like a slave
They completely brainwashed him and forced him to stay
Locked in his own office
Afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in New York
And it's pitiful, cuz I would have never said shit if you'da
Kept your mouth shut, bitch, now what
Hit it Clue, spit it Slay, new shit, exclusive
Yo Lantern, yo Who Kid, you know what to do with this
Use it, I'm through, this is stupid
I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this
And who you callin a bitch... bitch
You OWE me

Detroit

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a lil' static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody~

Royce Da 5'9
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise and now things changin a lot
He fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells but not by the seashore if he gang bangin or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me that G shall surely see/C, he definitely is 'bout it
It's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture, the trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier
It's me myself and I ridin 'round shootin my biopic and my autobiography, Range Rover
This ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin makeup, we thinkin Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles'll air his coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My pair'll shoot/parachute like skydivin in Hammer pants
So call it sibling rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin a grudge
is like lettin somebody just live inside of your head rent free
Real talk I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggaz been bitches, that's none of my business but I don't sip tea
That's Nickel Ride around his block
All he know is pitfalls, that's why he always climbin out his drop
I got a question Do you wanna ride or die Whatupdoe

Trick Trick
Yeah welcome to Detroit motherfucker Detroit

Big Sean
Sean Don
Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets'll still be at yo' ass firin
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin
Boy I hit the beat and just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dawg in the 'vette
Hah, plus I'm so loyal that that paper boy is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand then the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm over respected, my momma gated community's over protective
So futuristic I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin on listenin to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryin to get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet  Fifty Shades of Grey 
26 and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryin to get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 e'ry day, I'm hittin new primes
Now the steaks/stakes high, niggaz surprised at the new lines
Takin down my number like, You still ain't got a new line
Naw it's the same, we've been laborin for years
I know it took way longer than nine months but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein a Beatle
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When ya come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel let's go
Lil' bitch

Danny Brown
Comin from them streets where they thirsty, starvin to eat
Just a step away from failin, that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggaz hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
And to think y'all hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet yo' ass not rememberin
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Had K's in front your school but I ain't go to no Kettering
Cough up a lung, 3 13 where I'm from
Gan' got me cross eyed like Bernstein's son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them

Trick Trick
Detroit vs. Everybody, yeah

Eminem
Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was, before my life became a movie
And they used to use my motherfuckin trailer to tease me with
But I flip that script like a refiller, painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
And if I may reiterate I ain't even need a script, ain't bein conceited
but I made it to radio, eat a dick, I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin these streets I swear that I would stay here still in it
I'm crazy, I'll always be real uh, don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from on a rampage, you crazy for me to flip
What's makin you think I need a switch
Cause I'm Adrian Peterson, when he's ragin and heated and, on the way to go beat his kid
On the track get spank like he just did DETROIT I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein treated like me and shit
But Jesus I can see just why people quit callin me to do features and them cyphers on BET cause if
I wasn't me, I probably wouldn't wanna play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin this fever pitch, 180 degrees in here
Tryin to wait for the cedar chips
MC's just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish, or Lorena with two penises
Hateful ingenious, this inconvenience
And for the record you won't want this type of static in your life when I'm makin you cling to it
Then consider tryin to reinsulate you when it's maybe in for another crazy winter
Cause so cold in the D it is   as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde, but ain't we sick of bein underdogs
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit, may even seem as if
I'm yankin your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin shit
is playin with you, but ain't shit changin, it's still the same shit
And Shady's still a lady killer since the day I went insane and then attacked the baby sitter
with a potato peeler, and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
or the Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here
And if they mention us

Whatupdoe, it's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin with us, or gettin rolled on
That mean Detroit vs. EVERYBODY
Hey Em, let me get that instrumental, take it down to the hood
Let the lil' homies get this remix crackin
Detroit

Eminem
I roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone
This bed's empty without you, you said you're movin on
But I'm havin some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin Valentine's Day, fuck February, stuffed teddy bear
Guts everywhere, machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
How do I look You fuckin just left me here
to die, didn't you Why didn't you
respond yet I've written you
five or six different times and, I'm gettin sick and tired
of always apolo gizin to you; I didn't do
shit to deserve what you're puttin me through, this couldn't be true
We can't be over so, violets are blue
Roses are red, why is it everything I do
I'm reminded of you

Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointin toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said Honey, I'm back
Just so you don't die alone
Just so you don't die alone

Eminem
Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin back
Now every woman that I look at, I'm lookin for you
So I'm findin somethin the matter with them, excuse
to not see anyone, useless
Rather pick up, the phone not at all, followin protocol
I get bold/bowled like bowlin balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I wanna say, damnit
I'm drawin blanks like I'm playin hangman
I'm sick of playin these games, I can't handle
this heartbreak, it's makin me wanna blow out my brains like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake
I think I may have made a mistake   can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station, the same one's playin on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
And I'm havin all these visions of us at each other's wakes
in caskets and suddenly I wake, and THAT'S when I know I

Kobe
Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more, for the memories
Give me one more, make it taste like a steak
Help alleviate, it'll soothe this ache
Cause I really believe that
That she's really, really comin back

Eminem
And it's been a while now
But I finally realize how much reality sucks
But it's just somethin about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealin with the finality of
And it's makin me crazy, thinkin of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
Ain't shit I can do about it, now my head is overcrowded
with these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the FUCK do you sleep comfortably
knowin what you've done did to me
Huh Did it even occur to you that I loved you
Completely, deep and madly head over heels for you
Was you and me, it once used to be
Together forever it was supposed to be us but you crushed the dream
We were supposed to die together
And it's killin me so much when I sleep I wake up dead
Must be why I

Eminem
Another day, another hotel, the inside of it's nice though
Oh well, this is my life so, as I go try and close for the night's show
to, see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show
business guess I'll just never get   so this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because alls I ever did was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
other people say to me when I was a kid, so please don't make me some type of hero
Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way but still will have a field day
with some of the fucked up shit in the world and tell it to suck on a dick
Cause I still make fun of a sitch' someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense
I'm fuckin relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen, I struggle with comin to senses
Stuck on the fence or the balance beam, if I seem unbalanced, it's challenging
But my conscience allows me to think the most foulish childish things without even blinkin
Without even thinkin about, all the stinkin amounts of, people that seems to be reachin
While the crowds are screamin in The Palace sold out this evening, but now it's, lay me down to sleepin
Is it really my soul to keep or, have I sold it cheap Is it greed and
do I take more than I need when, when I joke of leavin
But keep overachievin cause what it stole from me I've barely broken even and

I know, it's a fine fine line
Live in a hole dying
I know, it's a fine fine line
Live in a hole dying...

Eminem
So an artist how I paint myself and through my heroin ordeals I'm so  vein , I want my respect
But ignore the, butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
'Til I, sit in the dark and I reflect and my reflection shows what it's like here
Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights, yeah, it's like a nightmare
I said this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
And, I don't like how I see myself so I, open the Bible to Isaiah
Cause, I swear to Christ there are nights where I stay up at night say a
prayer twice just to make sure God hears, cause this ice layer I skate on's a nice way of
puttin it but I like stayin feistier, than a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice pair of dice/paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit, good safe place to sit and talk shit from, this house it's quite big
But it ain't when you can't leave it and I feel
so isolated, nice I made it but it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life and make another song, it's a cycle, ain't it
Then I wonder why I stay famous, I keep walkin the line, this goldfish bowl gets old
But especially when you don't know if your conscience is sayin I told you so
Cause you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier, or you sold your soul cause

From here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back... to me
Yeahhhhh

Eminem
I still remember the times when, they were simpler than the rhymes of, Vanilla Ice were
When I was just killin the mics, I'll never forget what that feelin was like, I
miss those times now when I was just startin out with out a dime and
now I'm diamond, I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
stuck in this house hibernatin, hate even goin outside, it
sucks; sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit, browse, I don't
even wanna buy nothin, I just wanna fuckin walk around inside it, look how excited
I sound when I get, to talkin 'bout life and, everything about it I miss
Which now reminds me, put a thousand lighters, in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must've had Alzheimers, long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time cause
It's been on my mind lately how, Zee, you always supported, me, you vouched, I will
never forget that and, how you guys ac 
cepted me for me and Pace, I love you too, you slept on my couch and I've been
thinkin 'bout the time when I slept on the floor of the outhouse, rhyming's
all we ever wanted to do, and regardless how life has turned out inside, I'll
I'll always be an outsider, my life has been turned inside out but I

I keep walkin the line...
I keep walkin the line...
I keep, I keep walkin the line
I keep walkin the line...

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I, gonna do
It's too late to start, overrrrrr
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Eminem
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is, find different ways to word the same old songs
Ever since I came along from the day the song called Hi,  My Name Is  dropped
Started thinkin my name was Fault, cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media, made me the equivalent of a modern day Genghis Kahn
Tried to argue it was only entertainment dawg, gangster Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft, and I sound like AZ and Nas
Out came the claws and the fangs been out since then; but up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to un learn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game I pondered, I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised up on
But sometimes you gotta take a loss and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin, it's your only outlet, and your only outfit
So you know they're gonna talk about it, better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ahh
Feel like I've already said this a ka billion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my
story, betcha feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
when I was afraid ta

I was a, afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out out out
Afraid I'd never be fou ound
I don't wanna go another rou ou ound
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not runnnnnn
Guts, over, fear
The time is near
Guts, over, fear
I shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got   guts, over fear
Guts, over fear

Eminem
I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents, hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world, and the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song, learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit harder shit, learned how to harness it while the reins were off off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
was soon as I stopped sayin I gave a fuck, haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone and the lights go out in that trailer park oh OHH oh
And the window is closin and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from, just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
So to the break of dawn, here I go recyclin the same old song
But I'd rather make Not Afraid 2 than make another motherfuckin We Made You, uh
And I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God   I just open enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make ya strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt cause I can't explain to y'all
how dang exhausted my legs felt, just havin to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk, but thank you ma cause that gave me the
strength to cause Shady mania, so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it outta that house and found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just gettin accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them A holes talk, take it with a grain of salt
And eat their fuckin faces OFF~
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was a

Yo.. if you could just, for one minute
Or one split second in time, forget everything
Everything that bothers you, all your problems
Everything, follow me

Eminem
If I was froze inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule
An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it
If I could grasp it, and just control what happens to it
Then I could trap it, so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
to transmit through 'em to make you put your ass into it
And that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
Your passion's too much for you to not be dancin to it
And as you do it your movements become fast and fluent
You're mashin to it, moshin 'til you're black and bluish
You're actin foolish, this music it has influenced
you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion, true it's
chaotic but it's got your body movin as a unit
Unitin together tonight so make it last and you better just

Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go go
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time to sit there and procrastinate
You better

Eminem
As we descend together we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun
But if you could lose it once, I mean if you could let shit go
Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make 'em feel the feelin that I'm feelin right this minute
Cause I feel like the night won't end until I get finished
So close the shades, makin sure no light gets in it
The sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite
A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck cause they just like what's spinnin
His life was spinnin, the whole entire night just spinnin
Like life's beginning so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin in it

Killer killer killer killer killer

I guess you can consider it a poet
But with me it started out with these words, words words
They started lookin like puzzle pieces so I start connectin them to each other
'Til they started to resemble, blank canvases
By this time I was an artist
So I just started to see, these pictures, these real visuals

Yelawolf
Psychopath, I'm a killer killer killer killer killer
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer killer killer killer killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer killer killer killer killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer killer killer killer killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer

Feel it in the air, breathe it in the night
Starin at the full moon killer killer killer killer
Did you ever think, you would come to find killer killer killer killer
Maybe in my dream a psychopath, I'm a killer

Royce Da 5'9
I'm a psychopath, I'm never keepin it plain
Lyrical murder is somethin I've been about
Ever since I was a little kid, doodlin in class
Drew a picture of my teacher, bullet in his head, ruler in his ass
With a toilet in front of him, throwin up, pissed off
Probably symbolic of this thought, sick tot
To my inner enemy in a rush
I'm havin nightmares of leavin behind my dreams
with anything less than a full bank
It's like I'm General Hong and I'm standin in front of a gun
I'm puttin myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank
The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain't
Yeah, got the mentality of bein with a wizard
Every award show we don't even get considered
How do you sell somethin that's so lyrical to a kid
who wouldn't know what was hittin if it hit him hit him, hit him
Now I wanna talk about these niggaz from Detroit
Before me and Shady, who was thinkin 'bout Detroit
We put the world onto it
So watch how you say Fuck me
You just might jinx yourself, whoops, your girl gon' do it
Cause I was in the 9 11
in Chicago, 9:11 at the same time
I had already been grindin since '9 7
That's longevity and if you think you're lyrically better you better be a killer

I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer killer killer killer killer
OHH you ain't never seen a motherfucker get realer
A psychopath, I'm a killer killer killer killer killer
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
A psychopath, I'm a killer killer killer killer killer
Cause ain't nobody iller, no ain't nobody for realer
A psychopath, I'm a killer

Crooked I/KXNG CROOKED
This elite drinker is the ringleader
I'm a deep thinker, I'm a street preacher with a street sweeper
full of heat seekers in your Jeep speakers
I'ma keep ringers, I don't need heaters, I got the meat cleaver
Welcome to the Slaughterhouse
Niggaz try to tell me I spell too much
Capital S to the LAUGH to the T E R
HO, U S E, now go to hell you fucks
Word, makin work disappear quick as magic
Abracadabra, the trafficker blacker than Africa
Can you imagine a nigga flippin bread for the blood
Money like Dracula
Has him a spatula, ask me a question
Am I the best with the flexin
Fuck yes with the goon talk, I just moonwalk all over the beat
then I'm lightin up the street
Crooked goin Michael Jackson on Thriller

Eminem
The thought of retirin
is makin me wanna set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron and
What up mom, applyin for the rim job, are you hirin
I'm hopin to fill up your openin, oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements
First I gotta accept you're in the lobby and the aisle and
you've probably already been with all the Slaughter and I am in
no mood to be playin second fiddle, slob on this violin
with no strings attached, I'm just the product of a hostile environment
But bein brought up so brought up inspired
but I don't know why, it's still like I'm
caught up inside a  Whirlpool , not an appliance
But applyin this science I psychotically rhyme
And it's like stars have aligned all in alliance, heart of a lion, balls of Goliath
Obscene talkin, the twine like a beanstalk and a vine
But I keep walkin the line between the wrong and the right
But everything I write seems wrong and it's like
I'm ecstatic at all the static that I can
still cause in the fabric of our modern society, now Catholics are panickin
cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans
Damn it the pope's mad again
Probably shouldn't have ran up in the Vatican
with that mannequin singin Bagpipes From Baghdad again
in my dad's drag draggin a faggot in
a  GLAAD , bag, won't be the last time I make a dramatic entrance like that again
You thought I was lyin when I said I think that I'm crossin the line again
I've lost my mind, caution, oh God I think I just thought of another fuckin line
Forgive me Father for I have sinned
But hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent
... streak... defiant
Now the odds of me tryin to fuckin be quiet
probably gotta be 'bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant
after he's fallen in pollen next to a killer beehive
colony tryin to sneak by it
While his feet stomp, follow me while I revive rap
I'ma start up a riotin, try to stop it or silence it
You're not gonna, might as well just hit the block in your joggin attire in
Boston, across the Marathon finish line and I
put your thoughts against mine
Cause the arsenal I have'll scar you for life
worse than Dzhokhar's and I have a bomb, pliers and barbed wire
Your bars are like Barney Fife with a fuckin swiss army knife
A saber less Darth Vader with arthritis at a bar fight
with the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up
I'm Dahmer like when I'm on the mic, I'm not gonna lie
I perform like I'm gonna die at the end of a song so it's hard for the rhyme to end
Like fuck 'em all, I'm just ridin
Like I'm locked up inside of a shot up Bonnie and Clyde car
Uncle Ronnie was drivin, 'bout to barge through the side door
of Arkham Asylum and park in the dining room~

Eminem
I feel phenomenal as usual, pharmaceuticals, glue stick
to crucify me at Bonnaroo but I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago or Houston
In the corner tryin to seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude, I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa/Pizza
Top it off I'm on mushrooms so fuck all of/olive you
Roses are violet, mollies are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion, it's all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on cause I think I started hallucinatin
Cause I just thought I heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future's new shit
And all I could do is follow the music and end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Fillin water balloons with nail polish remover haha
... Just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes
I, feel uptight, I gotta get looser
After I finish polishin off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice, so I'm not as diluted
Cause all this delusion got me seein shit
Excusez moi but that coochie that passed   you see her ass
Wouldn't make her my main squeeze but, juicier ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth waterin too so I walked up into it
Oh, I'm a misogynist too but
I'm not a masseuse but my attitude's rubbin off on the youth, uh
You chronic abuser, and I don't mean user
of marijuana, I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke ALL of you losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a Ruger
A Glock and a nuke and a Rottweiler too, and I'm not in the mood so
When I say I'm bringin the TEC out, I'm not comin to re 
pair your fuckin electronic computers
God I'm gonna puke, I'm so gone off the hookah, I think I swallowed a loofah
I'm tore up, demolished, I'm fuckin  Stoned  like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in her eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are, Looney Tunes
The box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
to replace next up Veronica's boobs
And her paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box in a blue
Honda with used condoms were clues the, girl was just not the one suitable for

Right for me that will will change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don't laugh, please listen
Don't laaaaaaaugh
You're all trapped in my head

Eminem
Thought I'd give in to the pressure, collapse and crumble perhaps, relapsin under that
Well that's a bunch of crap, in the clutch I'm the Cap'n Crunch of rap
And I'm sick of actin humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack like it's a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shovin match cause push keeps comin to that
I can keep gettin my ass kicked, I'm comin back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit still mad disgruntled, had some struggles yeah
But that passionate hunger's back, what a fantastic jugglin act
And the way I flip my tongue on the track it's like verbal acrobatics
But in fact, last time I tried to pull off a dramatic
stunt as drastic I fuckin crashed my hovercraft
after I strapped the duffel bag to my back and stuffed a massive punchin bag in it
An elastic bungee strap, rubber, plaster, a thumbtack
and a piece of plastic bubble wrap, went spastic and fuckin snapped
Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid, stumbled back
Recovered, backflipped and landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
... And for my last trick, lunge on backlash on a NASA shuttle flap
Fuckin snapped the rudder in half, chuckled and laughed
Buttaled my last rebuttal, and just asked him
to come crash and I grab my Go Go Gadget
inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat
Rubbed my magic mushroom tat, fell off then splat, get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket, throw up then gasp, lungs collapsed
And that's more likely than findin someone that's

Eminem
Couple of shots of J�ger, public intoxication
Dis fuckin combobulation, flooded with thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin
You're top ten, ain't ya Stop cause you fuckers are talkin crazy
And stop interrupting, you're not even up in that conversation
Whether you're punchin a clock or famous
Underground, pop or nameless, whatever your job is I came to
fuck with your occupation, you're thinkin just cause you came in
with scrubs and you brought the scalpel and sponge, the oxygen tank and
the suction and shot the brain surgeon, stuck in the operating
room once you done swapped your names with him, smuggled in Ronald Reagan
if you dug him up, Donald Fagen while jugglin waffles bakin
A fuckin McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle
They flung it across the table then bump it and knock it, shake it
Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration
I said fuck it and lost my patience/patients, they all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of you Dr. Dre, so then what is it got you thinkin
you can fuck with this OPERATION
Aftermath Still runnin hip hop amazing
I'm still pluggin along, no need for assumption, here's confirmation
I'm up for the long duration
I'm just lookin for somethin to walk away with, some pocket change and
a little integrity, though I'll probably be jumpin across the stage
'til I'm fuckin Madonna's age and, stuck in an awkward place in
my life, but I shit you not like I'm plugged up with constipation
That day will come 'fore I finally stumble upon some lady that's

Eminem
I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust/discussed you, like dialogue, from The Shop to The Wired Frog
night club, shit I was taught if your CD's on fire
You had to put it out yourself like Highland Park
No fire department, so you might not hear sirens at all
but don't be alarmed if I sound off, somethin just ain't right with me dawg
A, martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder
Widely regarded, highly bite me sweetheart, I'm slightly retarded
But tonight I'm startin shit, I'm feelin self righteous
I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and 'Pac shit
Lookin to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
I'll fuck around and snort a ki'/key, and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of The LOX, bananas, manic, I'm goin in shock
Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet; panic attack cause I'm claustro 
phobic, no faggot, I mean I can't maneuver from movement
Cause I have no room for improvement
I'm practically squashed, compacted and boxed in, toxic, hands are arsenic
Flammable bars, examine the content
Bar exam, start of insanity, Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
RRR Animal snarls, cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter, lookin scandalous as Hannibal stalkin
Gallons of vodka but that gal has some knockers
I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious
Uhhh, what happened doc
I passed out again, alcohol's makin me break into vacants naked
Stolen Magnavox and bags of rocks in back of a Datsun
Fell asleep watchin Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the StairMaster, poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly thereafter hungover, no underwear
Graspin a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it
Air Max in my closet, a preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich
And the cross stitchin is a cross mixin of rhinoceros
Possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin, fin, cotton Dockers
OshKoshes, drop crotches, Swatch watches
and sneakers match with the Parkers, but it's like bein overstaffed at a boxin
gym, with all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers
And I'm standin here naked, hangover still wasted
like paper you write raps on, obnoxious
Yo~ Why does it always sound like I'm grabbin my nostrils
Fuck that I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall
I'll stand there and yell that at a wall 'til the mannequin dolls
scatter and the inanimate objects that I'm badder and all shatter and fall
Cause I hear the track and I'm startin to get fuckin amped
I'm a spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables hooked up to my fuckin back
I'm a Duracell but I sure as hell got it backwards
cause y'all'll get jumped, and I'll catch the battery charge but
I got a hunch like your back when it's archin
When I start attackin your squadron you'll feel like MasterCard when I'm chargin
So take a swipe at me, I'm comin straight at you like Clay Matthews
from the Green Bay Packers so, get the sack of Wisconsin
That's nutbag that I'm talkin, who am I kidding
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding   don't get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all
I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
Stretch tinted black sedan my ass, see how mad you act
when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave in a fuckin taxi cab to go shoppin
Affable guy next door is laughable
My next whore's gonna have mechanical arms that'll jack me off
with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard, I got a Magic Johnson
It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
Holdin a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
I'll laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is Paulie Malign', now she's Slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her, goddamn it I am a misogynist
I'll slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
Just so happens she's fond of algae
Cause now she faceplants on the conc rete, complete lack of responsi bility
Half of you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift 'em up
Boost the energy, klepto, I'm back to rip shop up
But my thing is this now, five finger discount
Been rappin so long I've been killin this shit, it's easy
Kidnappin your mom cause I'm still in/stealin this bitch, thievery
Ransom for JonBen�t, Ramsey and Chandra, Levy
And Gary Condit
Em Paul was scared if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse, get on some bullshit, perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts
at Action Bronson, Macklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth and
have some back and forths and, record a wack response to

Yo I put that shit on a greatest hits album

Now that was awesome It takes some massive balls to
do some shit like that, sometimes I have to ponder why people are like
What's the attraction mama
Is it the fact that I'm a, walkin, talkin, actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose that's pointin at you mama
Who knows at this point, it's always pokin so meh
Still get along with this voice, cause that's  The Monster  monster
So do si do with the meh
sociopath, everyone who knows me knows that
What they don't know is the fact Rihanna, calls me Pinocchio, meh
She  Loves the Way I Lie , sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathologi cal, liar, ahh, why am, I ah
such an asshole that my di sguise is pants but they're on, fire
So am I ah, woo Cappadonna
Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stockin
I'm wrappin up all the presents in fuckin camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowin a head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back, all the bath salt packets are gone
I, know you're really tired of me samplin Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar, splash of Bizarre, Thrasher and Aerosmith
And I'm a spectacular archer, feed count Dracula Chocula
Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan, bandwagoners
I'm kickin the damn stragglers off and I'm, stranglin 'em

Skylar Grey
You sit there stone faced, as if I'm not here
Can't you see that I've been crying
I didn't know you'd be, insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
You're an itch I can't reach, a wound that won't heal
The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be, insane
But it's true, and just say, all I am to you
Is a

Pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreamin of her, all of my, life but she won't come true
She's just my nightmare I woke up to

She's twis ted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
The worst of all, is he just don't carrrre
She's, twisted like a rope that he's wrapped, around his throat
But the worst, part of all is SHE REALLY DON'T GIVE A

Skylar Grey
Sometimes I wish, that you would just die
Cause I'm too afraid of leaving
I didn't know you'd be, insane
Dreams can be so deceiving

Eminem
How did it come to this Why do I fantasize
to kill you when you're sleeping

Skylar Grey   Eminem
I didn't know you feel, the same
When I say, you're no good, all you are to me
Is a

Yelawolf
Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail
inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married Well
Romeo Romeo smokin blow with Antonio
In the back alley takin shots of whiskey and only gold
Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse, ain't it
Sorry I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry Juliet that you embedded the sayin if a
dollar makes you holler, well then I'm gettin the short change of it
Uhh, feel like I've been asleep and alone
In love and this angel entangled between a dream and a coma
walkin the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to his owner
Then woke up to this fuckin BITCH, with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin with them
Then they pack up and leave then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin a carnival carousel
'Round and 'round we roll
Where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just want a free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry
If she's in the house of pain then love is standin outside

But maybe I'm the twisted one that screwed this up
So I guess this means goodbye, for now

Hahahahaha

Eminem
Got a shit eatin grin, bitch show me them itty bitty titties again
We're in Sin City, since when did we begin
to get 'dicted to dope, diggity bitch
You need to run and go get your friggity friends
I'm lookin at your bum stickity bum hun, the mickity mack's bickity back
Don't act wickity wack
You can get the fickity finger, the middle
You little dizzy bitch, sit and spiggity spin
Got a 6 o'clock craving   stop, get C�roc
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night, I call it surreal, Sir Mix a Lot tape in
Hit the spot, spot my next victim
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin
Came to sip vodka, shit yeah, that little chick is hot
But if she got rabies I wouldn't give the bitch a shot
I poke her in the rear, but I bet if I lick her/liquor
she'll try to chase me haha what are you Pit, Rott
Mixed Oh you just got fixed Well shit then let's lip lock
If not then chick piss off you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat, well bitch if you're solar
Then I'm your polar opposite dog cause I'm colder
than popsicle sticks, poppin shit, talkin it, walkin it, spit boxin
My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots
Like this shit's hopping and drip dropping in chocolatey whipped topping
So whether you're hip hop, Slipknot
Big, 'Pac, Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross
You'll dig this, if not then kick rocks in FLIP FLOPS
... And I produced the track
so you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knock TURN UP
So bring clairvoyance to this bangin, and I'ma keep on sayin
all the shit I should be hung for and probably killed for sayin
And I probably will but not until the day I pop a pill again
like choppin 'til I'm droppin, still if that don't do the job of killin
Shady then the karma will, they sayin I must bring it
as Mohammad 'til the Parkinson's done eat away my brain and
made me Robin Williams crazy or I end up with dementia
But you're rockin with a sadist, hate to say this
But if the thought is entertainin, I ain't stoppin to explain it
Oh my God for real man not again I'm shakin
But before I tie a rope around this knob, if they don't like it
got a knob that they can slob until it's   wait I just forgot what I was thinkin
... What's it called again I'm blankin
The thing above the balls between my legs and I think I can feel it danglin
It's throbbin and it's veiny wait
I think that I got it, okay bitch I got ya, Robin Williams hangin
Go hang in the lobby 'less you came to slob me
Come on kemosabe, it's past time like your favorite hobby
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on
my dick then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my
sausage as a hostage, ain't it obvious Pretty much a no brainer
Or should I say Cobainer that she's plain a 
ddicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
Gotta wean her off it
... Weiner off it
Like she took my fuckin penis, chopped it
And stuck it up between her armpit
as she began to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet
Least that's what her train of thought is
Cause I came, saw, conquered it, hit it, quit it, and made up a plate of bonkers
And I always end up givin these bitches a complex
And, I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart and let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart and make me breakfast bitch
That's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick what up
Said my name's Booger, wanna catch a flick I'll even let you pick
Make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you give this old dog these new tricks to get familiar with
I'll learn extra quick, kick a pregnant bitch
Oops I guess the shit, took an unexpected twist
Like the neck of the, freakin  Exorcist 
Ch ch ch ch ch Bitch I said that this
mask ain't for hockey, hate Versace Versace
I got M�nchausen by proxy
I'm makin you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf girl I said you was  Foxy 
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car
And suck my fuckin dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick
So, come blow my mind, and it tastes like humble pie
so swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee, unl l l less you're Nicki
Grab you by the wrist, let's ski
So what's it gon' be Put that shit away Iggy
You're gon' blow that rape whistle on me
'Fore I get lost with the gettin off
Like this is our exit, now let's hit the highway and try not to get lost
'til we get to Las Vegas

Party, do it 'til tomorrow, bizarro Vegas
'Til we get to Las Vegas
Do it 'til tomorrow Vegas
'Til we get to Las Vegas
Party, do it 'til tomorrow, bizarro Vegas
'Til we get to Las Vegas
Do it 'til tomorrow Vegas
Whatever, happens here, stays here
So let's go all, the way dear
'Til we get to Las Vegas

Royce Da 5'9
Whatever happens in my room
It stays in my room like movie night like cable
Treat every women in my stable like flavors
Lookin like she kryptonite
And I get  week  after like seven days
In seven nights in the Days Inn, it's Hot Vegas
We roll in circles and packs
We the  Lifesavers 
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
I'll bring it with me when I show up to her crib wavin
And I ain't tryna meet a nice neighbor
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Neck so frozen it look like I walked in a jewelry sto'
with about a million dollars with your mama
and sat down and did an ALS Challenge
Bad and Evil back at it again
'Bout to get my back tatted again
'Bout to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sittin on a bike in the sand
If you ain't been through nothin
then that shouldn't mean nothin to you like likes on the 'gram
If she current, I keep her pussy purrin like the pipes on the Lam'
Weed got her so chinky eyed
look like she been gettin high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fuckin
Sound like I'm shakin up dice in a can
Listen, though this ain't Christmas I'll make you my ex miss/X Mas
If this is my passion it's my passion
I learned to give those who don't appreciate my presence/presents
the gift of my absence bitch I'm gone
I don't know who you've been listenin to
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Bitch I don't give a two shits
Bitch get the fuck out of my face
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
and listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for witty banter
Startin to feel like foul play like Billy Laimbeer
Hold up, she misunderstood me, I said Saint, por favor
Thought I said the Wraith had four doors
I'll knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard whatever
I'll leave the club with my tab still open
Won't even get a cab for you and your friend
The only  Fear  I have is of  Loathing 
And I won't even kick in 'til we get to Las Vegas

Eminem
Hi
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling
with a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple hurry up
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
that my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
and said, I'm ready now bitch   ain't you feelin these kicks cunt
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphillis germs
and I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it yuck
Yuck  Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it
Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it

Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy    you hear me  Ha
Is fuckin crazy    hello, hi
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy    do you hear me
Is fuckin crazy

Eminem
I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
to save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of thai weed
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese
twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins    it probably all depends
on if I keep on killin my girlfriends

Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy    you hear me  Ha
Is fuckin crazy    listen
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy    you hear me
Is fuckin crazy

Eminem
Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
Shucks  I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be RRARRRRH
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin
Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been
It's probably AIDS  Forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
and pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
Somethin somethin somethin, somethin I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
Damn

From the moment I go to bed 'til I wake up, all day
So I'll go straight at opponents' heads with this anger, always

Royce Da 5'9
The chopper got about fifty bullets
Ain't no way it's accidental when I spill 'em on you
I'm the realist in the biz
How you livin ...
Cause you can get it how you live
And while you livin I'ma say my pull out game is so real
I'll still get rid of kids
Now that's ill...
The top of your head can fly off the top of convertibles
Ain't gon' really take no time to come through and murder you
I don't fake mine
I do this the fair way...
Snitches get stitches
Blown away and left on display
Hung by the grapevine
I just kicked the chair away...
Let me be the first to tell you that you're lookin at a superstar
My microphone and AK 47, that's my new guitar
I don't belong to you and I don't care who you are
Yeah you sold a couple records, got a couple joints
Nigga I'm a rock star

Eminem   Royce
With whoopin cough
I am sick, George Clooney with a uzi, what kind of a movie star
would hop out a moving car just to prove he's hard
Fuck you doin, you retard
Should be put in a cast as soon as we start shooting dawg
You swear I knew where the Roofies are
the way I drug a bitch, through the yard
Stuffed little Suzie in cardboard after wrappin her nude and newly scarred
body in water proof tarp covered in roofing tar...
So what you so blunt for Did
you fuckin fall off chump Or did you jump Or did you just become more with
Cause you're slippin into a funk, I just become morbid
and more self absorbed in my own world everyone orbits
Pen at the table, I don't know when I'll be able to stop, told you from the gate
One thought it generally takes and I'm off to the races, wait
Mentally stable, hold your fuckin horses...
There's nothin more disgusting, an animal, I just got done snortin
the fuckin bathroom soap and the tannin lotion, to unwarp this
mind you gon' need some sort of
an antidote, there's not a pill for bananas though, it's unfortunate
You got delusions of grandeur though
Actin like you're Michelangelo with a fuckin cordless
Bitch I'm Shredder so you better crawl back in your shell, or run 'fore ya
get injured, a fuckin Ninja Turtle wouldn't come tortoise/toward us
Two joint forces, of course this is what blunt force is
Cause we'd/weed smoke you on any joint
Bad and Evil's back bitch, you might experience some shortness
of breath, as you sit with your lungs punctured, here them motherfuckin tears come pourin
If I tell you once more then you're done for
You're gonna have to learn how to fuckin hear from a ruptured eardrum, Forest
Am I clear You  Gump , you're as
dumb as a stump to think we'd come with a trump shortage
B b b b, bass in your face bitch, Chuck Norris's
nunchucks morph into guns, swords
This is what blood sport is
The goriest, glorious, Notorious Big amous, shogun warriors

Royce Da 5'9
Goddamn The Slaughter boy general
Once I slaughter it, you couldn't un slaughter it
Once I order a hit, you couldn't un order it
Hit's an order, this the, consortium

Eminem
If I don't got no more drama bitch I'm a fish outta water
bottle, after all of these guys I slaughter
Applause is getting louder, how the fuck did this happen
I never rapped for bitches, how's it my audience now is broader
Devil without a cause, rebel without a pause
I'm a kaze without the kami/comma
You wouldn't be a G if it cost me a thousand dollars
Infrared in my pencil lead but always keep an extra one stocked though
in the back pocket and both of 'em locked and they're loaded
like cocked twin Glocks that I'm holdin
You better pause when you see these two dots on your colon
Fuckin punks, you wait, just got to rockin and rollin
Cause Elvis ain't left the building yet, I'm still a villain
You feel a threat when I step in and kill a set in a millisec'
with the weapon of intellect, Hannibal Lecter with the black belt and kung fu
Protect your neck and

Royce Da 5'9   Eminem
Respect the gun rule
Read in the Art of War book 'bout Sun Tzu
You realize if you defy
You probably won't be around here/hair long, Rapunzel
Get over it, look
Bitch I got the bands in my pocket and the drumroll poppin
That's... ehhh that's overkill
I keep the kill under me, I keep the chill one degree
I'll hit you with a hook, that'll make you see threes
You realize as soon as you beat me
that you didn't, yeah, it's still one of me
I'll meat slap you, that's a recap view, that's normal embarrassing
And you slap me, that's knee slap humor, that's hardly hilarious
So we scrap over you lying/lion like a feline cub in a forest cherishin
a kill from a dominant male

Eminem
And I'm born with Malaria
A form of Lou Gehrigs to the torture and terrify corporate America
Poor little Erica, in the morning the sheriff's
and law enforcement'll find one fourth of her buried under a barrier
of the kitchen floor with the stairs in an outdoor wooded area~

Royce Da 5'9
Back then hoes didn't, want him
Now the black Benz all hid in, corners
My spectacular vernacular
I spit like givin Ex Lax to Dracula
Let me translate, I'm tryna find me a bitch
And then I'm suckin on her neck while she naked
And then I'm, shittin, on her

Eminem
And I'm, gettin, boners from, what I'm, spittin
Gettin, blown to, smithereens in a Toyota
Gettin, stoner, Jonas, Brothers
Brothers, songs fricken rotisserie how these birds are flippin
'Nother murder victim, I flirted with them first and burrr stick 'em
I burn up if I try to step on inside a Church Chicken
Makin sure any who battle me crawl away
Assault and battery holiday, and just when you're thinkin that'll be all I say
I'll start automatically callin names
and rattling off fellow rappers so pardon the analogy
But I'll disappear quick as Natalee Holloway
It's my mentality all the way
I'm normally a suicide mission to try dissin
But one thing that I never mind's gettin
called Elvis all the time in the articles that you write which is why I never reply
cause he died shittin, so ah, shittin I'm spittin
my infinite supply of written
Bona fide, kiddin aside, critics stick my little white dick in
your eyelid and fuck it Switch subjects
Movin on to the next one it's CH Chucky
Who wanna play with number one overall KID Cudi
A psycho buddy who might go nutty cause he don't like nobody
His knife's so bloody cause he just sliced somebody
Pull out the Schick Hydro and

Royce Da 5'9
In light of what he
just said, this for those who even kinda want it
Cause for this man I would take a lighter and light up all of my Lighter money
You can call it pyro money, hi Rihanna
I mean wait, hi Tianna; wait, hi Tatiana
Shit I gotta problem and, I don't, like it
It's called fuck a model itis
Who pussy the tightest That's amazing
Sit yo' ass down, I don't like the pussy too tight
Get the fuck outta here and have some babies
Vocabulary, still ill
The 9 11 still will
It's all yellow with the black stripe,  Kill Bill 
I'm so far ahead of the skills here
Gettin ready for my past life, I'm  The Real Deal 

Eminem   Royce
Like Holyfield
Think you irreplaceable/ear replaceable Bite it That's overkill
'Til I keel over like somebody stuffed roadkill
and Ebola in my bowl of oatmeal, you know the deal
I'm not about to sit and go through the whole spiel
of how I'm, how I'm, cold steel like an old, cold snowmobile
and no feelin but so jovial
But don't be one of those who mistake me for a joke, I'm so for real
It's what I told the phony MC before I broke his will
Drove a drill through his skull to see his soul, told him when I snap like a photo he'll
get exposed like a roll of film
Now here he goes again
Oh, I'm so trill, I'ma get the hose again
like Buffalo Bill's, bitch you didn't put lotion in
the bucket, fuck it, beat the poor little old widow
with throw pillows, soap, Brillos, finished my goat milk then
Smoke billows, I lit up   ah, fuck it

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die...

Eminem
I can hear the drummer drummin, and the trumpets, someone's
tryna summon someone, I know somethin's comin, but I'm runnin from it
To be standin at the summit and plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was, was it
too good to be true Have nothin, get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, then I swallow hallucinogens
Cause if not, where the hell did it go Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den
by the dutch oven just choosin to sin
Even if it means I'm sellin my soul, just to be the undisputed again, do whatever I gotta do just to win
Cause I got this muh'fuckin cloud over my head, crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't, think I'd be back, did ya
How 'bout that I'm somehow now back to the underdog but no matter how loud that
I bark, this sport is somethin I never bow wow'd at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout
It's a love hate, but I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about is drivin around town with my fuckin whereabouts in a doubt
Cause, I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit or shit or stepped on but kept goin
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
Cause you're movin onto the next, but is your respect gone
Cause someone told me that

Gwen Stefani
Kings never die...

Eminem
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire
to dig deep, nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way, I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features
and try to show out on a track with me   but it'd actually
have to be a fuckin blowout to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die, I know shit has changed in this age
Fuck a Twitter page, did it just say I've been upstaged
Why am I online It's drivin me crazy, I'm ridin shotgun tryna get a gauge
on what's hot, but I'm not gonna conform, better stay
passin this, shit and opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
if I stay passionate, maybe I can stay Jay miraculous, come back as if I went away
But detractors just say some bullshit for the  Renegade 
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure, here I go again, to the stage
and I feel like I'm in a cage   they so want a champion to fall
I still wonder why I laugh at 'em cause why carry when I'm all so   fuck what these cynics say
It just goes to show that, when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again that I'll act as if I'm posted up with this pent up rage
Cause   cause all these plaques in my office, on the floor stacked against the door
All be just metaphors for the odds of, when you comin back again cause all
the accomplishments, accolades, awards and trophies, just don't mean jack anymore
Cause I'm here today and, gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be

I want it, I'm comin to get it so you son of a bitches don't duck, you're gonna get riddled full
Critics all end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
And, I ain't stoppin 'til, I'm on top again, all alone and, on a throne
Like a token of respect or a homage, poem or an ode, I've been on
Tossed in the air by my own arm and launched so hard I broke my collarbone
And when it's my, time to go, I'm still not leaving
Stop for no one, I don't know but, I've been told a, obstacle that
blocks your road to, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold cause
They say kings never die, just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly; so hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold up and provoke these moments
Cause in the blink of an eye, they'll be overrrr
Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur and ensure
that nobody's ever gonna be what you were, so before you're leavin this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berzerk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work, plus I'm thinkin that they're
mistakin my kindness for weakness, distill it with meanness
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silver screen where Rocky stepped with the demons, Khalil on the beat cause
Makin the beat ain't the same feelin to me is killin the beat, it's overfillin to me, it's what fillin a seat is
That sound, vomit, thirst and how common underground commons eat
Outsider stomach growl, throbbin hunger, out rhymin everyone, God just give me
one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever, entertainin even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear me say I ain't

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oooooh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oooooh
Oh, oh
Kings never die

With every ounce of my blood, with every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm pheno menal
However long that it takes, I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
But I'll never say ohh it's impossible
Cause I'm gonna be

Eminem
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin juggernaut that'll
Obstacles I'm drawn to 'em, when the going got rough
Show 'em what I done thought that was the worse
Lil' sissy, who the fuck taught you how to per 
The messiest thing you've ever gone through is your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell but I might as well hang it up like a shelf
Gotta keep growin with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
inside the realm where the unknown and boldly go
In the waters where nobody else has gone before
or willin to go, uncharted, feelin is so
bomb, I'm feelin myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that

Eminem
Let me self empower you
When you're down and they're tryin to clown the fuck out of you
When you feel like you're runnin out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel, convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put a spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Aww screw it, feel like you wanna hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your ALL into it
Now, you gon' take that rage and make that what you raise
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engage in this steel cage match
Ready to scrap ASAP
Take your fists to his bones, show who's  Big  and who's smallest
You're Christopher Wallace, yeah I picture 'em all as
plastic and foam and it lays flat where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on it like a placemat
... And I want you to SAY that

Liz Rodrigues
Step into the unknown
And find yourself your glory
Free the ignoring person

Eminem
Got a fuckin mouth, with no shut off valve
Can't even cut a power to it, but it's what allowed
me to come up out from under the fuckin ground cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin tongue, that's how I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non believers
But when you're beyond belief you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give, rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield
I'ma knife this will, sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still
an uphill climb, ready to face it, each challenge waitin
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin is a false statement
An accusation   I'm legendary status
In fact, that is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Your legend is, makin an allegation
I write with the left
Same hand I hold the mic with, as I fight to the death
'til my last breath, managed
to prove who the best man is, prevailin
All cards be the only one left standin
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
of knowin what it's like to be  Southpaw 
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause

Everything I say be raw
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw
Everything I say be raw
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw
Good God, everything I say be raw
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw
Everything I say be raw
Everything I say be raw

Royce Da 5'9
You can never be my nemesis
You against me is me bein a fool and you bein an enemy with benefits
I don't even consider myself deep
when I'm rollin with thirty niggaz
cause I'm so used to, bein in a syndicate
Boots on with my strap on me
You don't know how Yeezy the season finna get
Bad and Evil, catch a body, catch your body, that's a membership
Woo Put you on my hitlist
Then turn around and kill up all the snitches
Then turn around and go to church, repent
Then ask the reverend, Can I get a witness
Ha, I got an I.O.U. on my Bible's view
Even God knows what I'm liable to do
when I'm high bro
I represent the same significance in hip hop
as 'Pac and Biggie driver's side car do'
'cept I'm alive though
Best believe I got nooooo problem
fuckin yo' bitch, raw
And that mean I got nooooo condom
Panamera Porsche, factory real white
That's me in real life
And I'll probably, be m�nagin/Minaj'in
more than the back of Meek Mill bike
I'm Hollywood

Good God Everything about me raw
From the lyrics to the gun play
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw
Man I mean it, ohh
I'm raw Everything I do be raw
What I do, I do it one way
I'm hardbody, everything about me raw
And I mean it

You're on top of the world.
Every motherfucker wants to get a piece of your ass.
Then, you take a little time off from being unstoppable
just to, regroup and, relax.
No one will give you the time of fuckin' day.

Eminem
I'm THE roster, rest of y'all just one of the
I'm becomin what I used to make fun of a
Smug son of a, bitch, fuck it though, go for the fuckin jugular
Leave 'em in a puddle of, blood I'm a
killer but I'm a, cut above the others, bloody glove in a
prison yard, dirty Arias I'm comin for
you, fuck if the, world doesn't ap 
prove, here I come as a custodian, I'm dressed to smuggle ya
Ass out, wrapped up in a, comforter
Come snuggle up with a nother fuckin nut
We'll make a tub of  Truffle Butter , I'ma take this chubby, shove it up
that nice round little bubble butt, make it double stuffed
... Pull it out one hole, put it in the other one
Make a peanut butter cup
Bust yeah we can fuck on a, golf cart
Tell me how you want it, soft, hard or, fuckin rough/ruff like a dog bark
Stop at the Walmart, get a couple of
50 watt bulbs with a hot tub
Fill up them, buns with a hot dog
To be  frank  these other muh'fuckers ain't even in the  Ball Park 
Then she pulled out the condiment drawer
She must heard this is where the condoms get stored
Sign above the door to the sauna says Welcome to Sodom and Gomorrah
Told her I, got somethin for her
Sharp and it's pointed, and its head's on swole
Hold it like a samurai, she said Whoa
Look at that bulge, must have a huge ego
I said, Is it me you're aimin that compliment toward
She said Yes my ninja, please get to stabbin this shit
I commenced to, droppin them drawers
Threw my black belt and gauntlets all onto the floor
Zipped down my fly, whipped out my confident SWORRRRRD

So that is why I am better than everyone in the world.
Kiss my ass and suck my dick, everyone.

Hey look let me tell y'all somethin, aight
What I do, I do, straight like that.
So ain't no sense in y'all even troublin y'all selves over that.
Cause man the way I feel right now today...

Denaun
I came up on the wrong side of the fence
I gave my family pain and strife and asked them all for strength
But hell in my defense
And I got too much way too fast, momma told me it won't last
Now I'm back down on the bottom wishin that I took another path
I should've listened, but my mind was gone
My temper too quick so when my fuse get lit yo when it's on, it's on
Yeah, e'rybody wrong, yeah, and I'm always right
Yeah, ain't nobody to blame now, it's me vs. me, man this my fight

So don't look at me
like I am the same person I was before, fore, fore
Now, we all deserve a second chance
And this time I think I can do more, more, more
Or better

Yeah I put that on my family
All you gotta do is give me the chance me the chance
And I can show you that I'm worthy of the trust that you require
Put it all on my shoulders, I'm a fighter, I won't get tired
When I'm back up in this corner
Back up in this corner, tryna get out
Back up in this corner
Back up in this corner, gotta get out

Denaun
You think I got none but I got all kind of sense
Stop judgin my book by the cover, maybe you should do a little reconnaissance
And I ain't tryna vent
This ain't woe is me, it's nothin owed to me
Keep the swan song, I don't need an ode to me
Shit, hopefully holdin this rosary
will keep me out of close calls with the old police
I said I'm tryna be a whole new me, I ain't tryna do the same old thing
I'm tryna prove to my family that I will not bring
no more trouble around, I ain't gotta do nothing but stay out of shit
I ain't gotta be up in the chaotic, it's
probably cause it's my redemption, that I'm entrenched in
And I won't let anybody deny my vision, it's my decision
But y'all ain't listenin but y'all ain't listenin

Denaun
It's my gameplan now
Is to get in this ring and show that I'm a changed man and how
I won't blow another chance to make you proud
Even though you got the right to hate me now
I know you lost your hope in me, but hopefully
I can restore that back where it's supposed to be
I just want my daughter back, this fight mean much more than that
I'm tryna think before I react
I ain't get the message at first, I tried to ignore the facts
But I'm much older, she's my soldier, I told ya, I'd go to war for that
I said the boy is the truth and it's no lie in him
All he need is his family with him
Y'all want him 'til it's no room given
I'ma hit him 'til the ref come and get him

It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat, and a catchy hook

Eminem
If we gotta dumb down our style and, A B C it
then so be it, cause nowadays these kids
Jeez, don't give a shit 'bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playin them hits
Oh this my jam, this my shit
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the song's ginormous, the whole formula's switched
cause we don't know anymore what are hits
Is it the beat Is it the rap
Is it a finger snap or the same 8 0 8 clap
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
when 13 year olds control the remotes
And Ashlee's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em phas is on our syl la lables

Jay Z
If the emphasis on a compact disc
isn't a beat then I'm gon' feature Em and get rich
and let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Rove'
Cause e'rywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
The bang bang, look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing' cost Jermaine a lot of dough oh
The fuck am I bustin my brain fo'
It's just the way the game go, and oh it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow You bought the shit
I guess you to blame too, I just found the angle
Hehe, no more reality flows
I'm tryin to time my album droppin with a reality show
Cock the mac 11 front of Hot 97
And call my publicist, tell her we in press heaven
Hehe, no one gives a shit except
some kids that just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house in Malibu
Em, your emphasis is on the wrong syl la lable

Dr. Dre
Jay said 30's the new 20, funny
Must mean 40's the new 30, interestin
Cause ever since then it's been in essence an extension
for veteran rappers that are better than half of
the shit comin out right now, it's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it's his last, then 50 and Em
Then what Detox drops, what do we got then
So now our whole camps is runnin around, scramblin
over what to do, gamblin
Every time we put a record out just lookin for that hook

Em Wait Dre, look~

Shorty I love youuuuuuu
And you loooove me tooooooo
We were meant to be
Cause shorty you love meeeeeee
And I loooove you tooooooo
And I promise I'll be true to you

50 Cent
Go shorty, it's your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
I run G for days, you should see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked 'round the globe
I'm sick right into shows when ridin on lo lo's
Puffin on cocoa, my bitch in Manolo's
Don't fuck with the dodos, that's slang for dumb hoes
Think I'm playin I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around you could get yo' ass smoked, loc
It's not a game, me B, I ain't playin
Be behind me playa, so you here anyway
You don't hear what I'm sayin, me finini nay
Fee fideedee day, just give me my check then I'll be on my way
Sonny bunny money you're funny
You ain't even listenin and I just took your money

Stat Quo
There once was a time everywhere he turned
Shady/Aftermath was all you heard
But they said 50 sang too much and Em got soft
And they said Dre just fell the fuck off
Well fuck the fuck offs, all y'all eat salt
Be mad, we back fresh up out of the vault, oh
New syl la lables, eat balls you fuck offs
Yo' house, yo' bitch, I'm gettin sucked off
East, South, Midwest, even up North
Fallin victim to wax spittin, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I'm runnin past while y'all walk

Ca$his
Shady made me for bringin it back
For the history of rap, it's gone with a snap
A snare, and a clap
What happened to just spittin 'bout livin in the muh'fuckin city you at
In the grimiest condition, I breathe in drama
King Mathers and Ca$h meet, that's freak karma
I'm everything anything you could never be
It's a hittin, rhymin a month deep in the beat
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done to mine
No rest, contest, contract is signed
By blood I'm in this squad for life
Air out my windpipes and, I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I'm crazy, Renagade like Em and Jay Z
I'm Rosemary's baby, I want you to hate me

Nobody gives a damn about them syllables, syl la lables
Whatever they are
I don't care if they gotta rhyme Schmoe, moe, Joe, toe and flow

2Pac
Sometimes its hard, to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screamin'
Cuz they seein destruction before they see a human bein
So they start smoking, we will never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shake
Cuz they all broken, why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, somebody else should try 
Cocking guns, smoking, we can all make a change
So I'm told but I haven't seen a change unfold
I'll keep hopin please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need, of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
Away the tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
Before they daughter open wise, my brother's speak wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies

Eminem
We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental stakes, settle down and set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate 
Cuz by then its just too late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just brakes, snaps, and its all it takes
You think that we was learnin from other rappers mistakes
But we ain't, its plain to go against, 
With every artist comes the image he portrays and the picture that he paints
But in the mist of all this anger and this angst 
Never once did you heard me say I'm a gangster and I aint hear any complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead, and never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee 
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free
To this day, the game, will never be the same
No matter how much fame and success they attain
There will never be another me 
And no matter what they do, there will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
We will never die, we are forever alive

2Pac And we continue growin, one day at a time

Outlawz
Don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money ya like
Seachin for fortune and fame and superstardom
All the jury, all the calls, who grouse is harder
There's not a hip hop police, the villains is watchin
And the kids think beef, is they only option
Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories took a die, my Macaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun, and no pity with guns
And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he die, and came back, would he try to save rap
We needing a change, the drama remains  the same

I spend my whole life, yeah fightin myself
That I cant win, so I'm invitin some help
And hey now then, I take rights and no lefts
I'm still, just like a kid, lookin for stripes on my belt
Yeah, that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope God, take a light to myself
No matter how much I try, stay alive, I'm a die a man
Still standin there in love my pride

My heart , we passed that
I'm tryin to keep  keep comin and collect all my ass cap
The rappers in the game ain't change
And I finally realize that we not in the same game
The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it
Them .45's will pop killa's, yes I'm still with it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers
They do what they gotta do to shock them and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind

2Pac And we continue growin, one day at a time

2Pac
Damn

Only reason I dissed you in the first place 
is cause you denied seein me
Now I'm pissed off

Eminem
Sit back homie relax, in fact grab a six pack
Kick back while I kick facts, yeah Dre, sick track
Perfect way to get back, wanna hear somethin wick wack
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm  Obsessed  now, oh gee
Is that supposed to be me, in the video with the goatee
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch shut the fuck up 'fore I put all them phone calls out
you made to my house when you was  Wild'n Out 
before Nick, when you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin to count
Better shut your lyin mouth if you don't want Nick findin out
You probably think cause it's been so long
if I had somethin on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary Mary Poppins I'm mixin our studio session down
and sendin it to masterin to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do, Mariah it ever occur to you
that I still have pictures However you prefer to do
and that goes for Nick too, faggot you think I'm scurred of you
You're gonna ruin my career you better get one
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
that made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once
Yeah, what you gonna say I'm lucky
Tell the public that I was so ugly that you fuckin had to be drunk to fuck me
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick pumpkin
The second week we were dry humpin, that's gotta count for somethin
Listen girly, surely you don't want me to talk about how I nutted early
cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
and said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin me I'm embarrassin you
And don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as that song's gettin airplay I'm dissin you
I'm a hair away from gettin carried away and gettin sued
I was gonna stop at 16, that was 32
This is 34 bars, we ain't even third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah play you, Mariah who
Oh, did I say whore Nick I meant a liar too
Like I've been goin off on you all this time
for no reason, girl you out your alcoholic mind
Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it now I'm 'bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
on an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go openin your jibs
Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin this shit again hoe, you know what it is
It's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and, I'll release every fuckin thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
when me and Luis were tryin to stick two CD's in the same slot

Eminem
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear boo
Now should I, keep goin or should we call truce
Well tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone
Damn

I see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's sayin cut the tape, cut the tape, knife

Eminem
Yo blast me off, Tim
Blast me off, son
Blastin' off right now, son

I wasn't born mean, I was pushed to treachery
I walk the streets lookin' for some puss to fetch me
I'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't gimme kin, things could get messy
So pass that ass to me let me squish the left cheek
And press against the right one till its smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods to MC with the Christopher Reeves beef
We started out on the wrong foot, or should I say fake leg made out of wood
I shouldn't, yes I should
Riding through the hood, I'm chillin' with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like Jello, I'm like hello
To a cute little dyke on the mic I'm kinda like...

Eminem
Me and Westwood blastin' off, jackin' off
In a pair of acid washed bumpin' Asher Roth
Cruisin' grassy 'till I damn near crash the car
Tryna smash 'em off in the dash, hit the overpass, went off
Over the bridge into oncoming traffic
Cause a massive forty two car pile up, not a scratch at all
Hopped up holdin' a axe and saw
Jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tobasco sauce
Spittin' flames, kickin' fire out ur ass you little  
You can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdrawal
Dick so big it's like elastic, I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of Plastic man with a drastic force...Put my penis on classic sports

Eminem
Once again it's the sinister, cynical, minister Shady
Kryptonite the Superman, he's a Dennis to Amy
Administer of the pain, just finish, cover the paint
And muffle the fumes like it was nothin' because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he spray reaches like beads of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares making the hairs all on the back of yah neck stand
Like dracula yep, spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yah, Angela so I command yah to start dancin'
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical
Sharp,throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansen
Enter my gas chamber, yah gangsta My ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table
I'm checking the exposure, a full dose of me
exposing myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
bodies eroding while I'm dozing off overdosing
Windows opening shutting, doors opening closing I think there's a ghost
Too much hydrocordone on coating
I was only 'sposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink posing
Myself, self loathing, cause I'm on a brink, postally
I don't wanna think this will make everything rosy
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in, I'm yodelling Rosey, won't you come out to play
A nuisance, wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines in the papers
Making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put nervines in my syrop and stirred 'em
You never heard 'em like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, I'm lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy, turn him, convinced that he emerged, took over the world
And reeled in all the children, lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels 
And still can spit, drawn to gold like Rumplestilskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills, the Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin'
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildrid
He's ill wit it, he still shouldn't be heeled
There's no one as sick as he MC's will get freakasied on the grill then

Eminem
You wanna start with the hook first
You wanna start with the.. Oh..
I have no idea what I'm doing, I have no idea what I'm doing, but
Everybody get up, sit up, Christopher
They're miserable without you, Superman is a 
Live and he's flowin like the Mystic River
Girl don't act like you've never been kissed before
One, two, three, four
Five, six, this uh
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How did anybody ever find me I disa 
Peared I was hiding in Freeway's beard, just a
Hop, skip and a jump from  my skin, gushin'
Nails into my face that I been pushin'
Hellraiser, my face is my pincushion
It's like when I'm on the mic I can squish a
Sucka like a vicegrip, my pin put ya
In the slaughterhouse cause your style's been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw, take off like the blades on, my brains on
Hyperdrive, someone put the breaks on

Eminem & Kon Artis
Here's a smidget, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice

Eminem
...Cause he gets as busy as a
Bee baby you could throw a frisbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he He's a wizard
Standing in the disco with a disco biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't biscwit, is it
Now baby don't forget to bring your lipstick with ya
I want the kiss before I blow this bitch to smitha 
Reens, get the guillotines, this is a situ 
Ation that's critical as Dre spins his, uh
Turn tables and he cuts the record like a scissor
Checka chicky checka chicky checka checka chicka
Who wreck it in a second tell me what the heck is sicker
Wait a minute I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now baby just to make a little breakfast and it's six o 
Clock in the morning unless you want to get some dessert

Eminem & Kon Artis

Eminem
Ayo, just so everybody knows...
That was a hook we made on the way to the radio station
And we were trying to get it right
so we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever
But, this is what we were trying to like work out before we came here
Especially for Westwood, man ESPECIALLY for you homie

The Wild.. Gotham
Ha ha, riiiiide..

Dr. Dre
All you see is the sun, reflectin off of the gun
I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin gold, waitin for this drama to unfold
Feelin bold, gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
but I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said

Eminem
You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
but I know you   the name's Slim   you want revenge
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you..

You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die

Dr. Dre   Eminem
He was Shady, I seen by the look on his face
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want
I figured he was tellin the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group
The Chronic
Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it
Who
Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle 
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun Dre here's the plot

Eminem
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin around sayin he took the game from us
Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin
But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip hop heads
Our mission   is to get him to stop layin eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps

Dr. Dre
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin   it sounded like a G Thang,
I said It's Dre's Day, and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin every which way

Eminem
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold

Always die..
The Wild.. Gotham
Ha ha, riiiiide..

I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
Patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action
Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer 
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood
As a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood
That I used as an excuse
And aint shit changed
But kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not  Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

It's only fair to warn
I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord
Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board
That smashed into your Honda Accord
With a 4 door Ford
But a more toward  droppin an accapella
The choppa  fella
The mozarella
Worse than a hellacopta propella
Got you locked in the cella
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia
While I'm standin next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins
Feeding you liquid darvicet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance
And driven
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
And given
A less than 20 percent chance
Of living
Have a possible placement
It's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream I'M STILL ALIVE
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson
To set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit 
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit

Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40
Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said case closed end of discussion
I'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombas 
We blowin up your house killing your parents 
and coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I aint making no more threats
I'm doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack  
today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath
Walk the block with a labrador
Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure

Eminem

The girly I fucked last year when her hair was curly 
Couldnt remember it cuz I was Infinite
And I met ken Kaniff in Connecticut
He said his predicits and pronouns and wanted to throw down
And he said I like you...

Girls wanna blow us like Monica....Lewinsky

Eminem
Go and see I'm an invincible Mc
If you dont believe it then you wanna try to convince me
That you're doper than me...which we'll hope
You would hope to be....but hopefully I will rock globaly
And nationwide...thats why my ass is wide
Thats why your ass just died on the passanger side...
Like a fuckin ride...when it got shot up by a drive by
When I drove by 5 times and gave it five tries
And still missed it
I got a fuckin mental illness a gentle stillness...
Violence...complete silence is what I need 
in the room while I freestyle
What I need is to do...what is need is smoke weed and brew
And......smoke brew  You don't smoke brew...
If you do I'll choke you and then I guarantee I'll out smoke you
You're crew's a joke too

Eminem
The rhyme that I dropped is stickin up IHOP
In high tops and walking around like a one eyed cyclops
And you can't see me....I only got one eye and I can still see you

Eminem
Yo, speed racer, 97' burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury tracer
I'm on some low ish, 
I'm fed up wit the being broke ish
I'm not to joke wit
Bitch, I don't sell crack, I smoke it
My brains dusted; I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many asprin tablets and empty medicine cabinets
Loosing battles to wack rappers 'cause I'm always too blunted
Walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' like, Who want it
Thug and crook; every drug in the book I've done it
My 9's at your frame,is that your chain Run it
Who wants to die of an overdose of excessive flavor
Aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer
Stole your mom's Acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her
Right right right       Ding    
The doctors you'll need after our battle are known as psychiatrics 
I'll tell the nurses to hold a bed for you, 
and I'ma make sure you come back for it
So barricade your infants, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses  Ooh 
..Take em' on long vacation trips
Kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Gut you wit that razor that I use to shave my nuts wit  Laughter
Mama don't you cry, your son's too far gone
I'm so high, I don't even know what label I'm on
I'm messed up, feelin' like an over worked plumber
I'm sick of the crap, what's Dr. Kevorkian's phone number   Ha.. Hot 

Gorillaz
Back the fuck up
D12

Proof
There ain't no trouble in rock rock
On every block block
Late for School, Late for Work
But ahead of these cops cops
My credit is shock, in the detinate box box
Like, people take my life and thats pathetic as Pac's Pac's
A waste of the talent, Say my boys is just no where
Placed on the planet, remain in poisonous warfare
Derelict Arabic terrorists in the air
Shit arrogant apparent to punish people by their heritage,
Nato barriers, Hate embarrassed
There is the faith to cherish
In your room face to face with race awareness
A race to s army bombin' your God is with you
Calm over war, we gotta start our pistol
Cause if you right and, know you right, then where's your ritious ways
We sacrafice, snatch your life, many nights and days
Follow me into equality we might behave
And only christ can say the trife will reunite again

Kuniva
America Owns, Without a fucking care in my dome
Bearin' my bones, so far away staring at home
Stay at my zone, falling asleep late with my chrome
Feelin' hype from these rockets burning like straightenin' in the cones
Stay at the streets, bullshit and plans to beef
Spray at your peeps for christmas, give a K to my neice
Real nigga's feel us and fear us
Gorillaz beat on they chest when
Dangerous lyricist, I hope that you hear us
The spirit of Bugz is still in me
God bless it the trinity
Cause my bullets they come in three's like trilogy's
Put the knife away, missles away strike and blaze
So much smoke you can't tell the difference between night and day
Right away blow your life away, so light your haze
Hold tight grenede's so when it blows I'm slightly grazed
Kuniva might be crazed unleashin' unlikely rage

Aaaahhhiyyyaaaa
Ahhhayayayayay
Aaaahhhiyyyaaaa
Ahhhayayayayay

Bizarre
Everynight I talk to a black hawk, taking herion in bulks
Watch my body hit the chalks
I'm too lazy, mescalines got me crazy
Rape this old lady, while the bitch was having a baby
And I ain't never going home, Bizarre can for go
It's cold I'll be for cyphering, right from wrong
As I sit in my seat and remain calm
And close my eyes and wait for the bomb Here it comes

Swifty
I'm gettin' the fuck on, I'm aggrivated
I know I'll make it, Im in a place full of hatred
Treatin' my life like a sacrred
Try to check me, I break your neck
Disrespect me you get injected
It's hectic with some bullshit that happen
You least expected
We just don't accept it nigga
I go ahead, lift my trigger
Get rid of bitches, pay you a visit, then get your shit lit
I'm a nitwit with a big dick, and big balls
I don't miss shit
I hit all, whoever that did this
We Gonna Getch'all

Kon Artis
Yo, yo
Now whether its Sadam or Bin Laden
Thats been startin all this trouble for us
Creepin horrors doin show after show, sleepin on the tour bus
We lost Aaliyah, lost our families, it takes no Tenges
You dont need us to say the world is fucked up dawgs can see it
Now it seems the public needs this shit to calm its kids
Cuz they findin out how you lied about your twisted sins
They say we bad for you but shit our music is your friend
They cant deter you from the truth cause we the helping hand

Terry Hall

We are one, and one is all
We are, We are, we are one
And one is all

Black Cotton
Black Cotton
Black Cotton   A symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is  listen
Robbin' Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak

Black Cotton
Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessin's
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave In the nine tre'
Answer that then answer this too 
Loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative
What's the matter G Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung Do ya feel me
Dum dum diddy is it me
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets  deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies   POOF
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton In God's eyes

Nobody don't care
No matter how hard I try/Look to the sky/  
Nobody don't care
Seems like my dreams/Drowned in by screams/No answer to my questions
Nobody don't care
Feels like I'm pressed/Why do I stress/It's like I'm being tested
Nobody don't care
Seems like my prayers/Vanish to thin air/Please answer my questions
Nobody don't care

In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up
Running out of luck, about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool
But it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what I know
I don't trust none
Look what the 80's did
To what's Bebe's kids
And now we grown up
Nobody ain't own us yet

Black cotton, I'm plottin'   
I'm workin' without a profit
They shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin' but keep the mind

certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
What's the reward for a strugala
If the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up
Runnin up, Gun cocked like nasty gloves
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove
No love
Waitin' for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze
Biblicle times good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton   I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton   I ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine
Black Cotton

Nobody don't care
No matter how hard I try/Look to the sky/  
Nobody don't care
Seems like my dreams/Drowned in by screams/No answer to my questions
Nobody don't care
Feels like I'm pressed/Why do I stress/It's like I'm being tested
Nobody don't care
Seems like my prayers/Vanish to thin air/Please answer my questions
Nobody don't care

Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me

2Pac
Posse deep as I roll through the streets
Motherfuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin so low you'd think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beef I'm robbin niggaz of they teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play toughy
Last time them niggaz rushed me I ain't bust but now I'm touched
Trust me, ain't nuttin jumpin but these buckshots
Them motherfuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold ya
Motherfuck a soldier ready to roll or take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin cause there's no stoppin 'til they rubbed out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Smoke risin from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge now count the bodies
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Tryin to keep a nigga down but you failed
Before I let you take me, I told ya
Fuck bein trapped, I'm a soldier

I betcha that's how I got some things you ain't got
that's called courage, and it don't come
from no flick or bottle, it ain't scotch
It's not bourbon, I don't walk around
like no G cause that ain't me
I'm not that person, I don't try
to act like you do cause that ain't you
You just burpin, you ain't

2Pac
2Pac in the mad bitch
In the six fo' rag on them thangs, that's a bad bitch
Gettin ghost on them bitches in the town
Bustin out the back seat nigga when we clown
Comin 'round the corner spittin rounds, they can't hold me down
Caught them sucker ass bitches outta bounds
Now tell me how that sound, a double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgment day
Now tell me how that sound, a double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgment day   stinkin beotch

Your man grillin' and he just up on my tennis shoes
I think we met, we gettin' checks like 
You see her shinin' with diamonds, glass, a swimmin' pool
All the women drool, when they see the linen jewels
The way you drifted by, it really got me in the mood
Take me to the room and blow me up like a inner clue

Valet park

Hit the room, you know, until I skeet, skeet
I hope these clowns in here ain't tryin' to start beef
Cause that'll be the reason that niggas kickin' your front teeth

Shit, this with the naughty
He's about to get the
Shit, kicked,  out of him

Tip Toe
I don't got no time for these niggas that's playing games
I don't take it as a diss unless you sayin' my name
I'm a bad influence, I smoke weed in front of kids
I crack a bottle open and ask 'em
If they wanna swig
I'm the bad guy that touched your wife
Tip Toe ain't nothin' nice
I rob Benz and still sport a gang of ice
We gettin' money, we ain't trippin' off you hoe niggas
Cause if we want you, we'll come show up at your show, niggas

Jayo Felony
He 'bout to get the
Shit kicked the fucked out of 'em

Head for the pushin' and shovin' 'em
So crazy
I harass and embarrass him in public 'em
Just sayin'
Hit a stick that get a guerilla pissin' me with that is Crip

Never sound like an amateur, I damage niggas' brains
This buster

Niqle Nut
Got a couple of handguns, feel like my block is ready
And I'm livin' it Thug Life, like I was Makaveli and
Nigga, this Zoo Life, nigga, I ride for it
I'll die for it and do federal time for it
I'm a Inglewood nigga, just have it at any brother

Got socas in line, dancin' like it's Soul Train

40 Glocc
The party don't pop off, unless we pop up in it
If the drama jump off, the first to dive up in it
Infamous G on it, baby, Shady, Aftermath

I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading, 'cause I know where I've been

The flow is bone crushin', it's nothin'
I come up with somethin'
Come through your strip, frontin', stuntin'
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winnin'
Man I've been hot from the beginnin'
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm fittin' to catch a felony
Pistol in hand homie, I'm down to get it poppin'
Once I squeeze the first shot gun shot, you know I ain't stoppin'
Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with, or fuck with
Hollow tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smokin', still locin',
what nigga, lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling

Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got somethin' for your ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy

Lloyd Banks
I done lost my bigger nigga, and I didn't cry
To young to understand, the consequences of a man
Livin' a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas, cause they funny   
20 years, of watching my mama's tears
Got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong, cause I need it
These niggas don't want me ballin', they want me buried
Balled in the dirt, from shots flurried
Layin' with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
'Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels, gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flyin'
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm runnin' from nothin', my stomach is touchin', what I'm clutchin' 
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder, so I'm bolder
Hennessey and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier

Eminem
These are my ideas
This is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my balls, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be
What you see on TV, what you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boopers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies
Frontin' like it's all fun and games, 'til the shoot'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playin'
Ain't sayin' we ain't layin' down at night and ain't prayin'
I bullied my way in this game, man I'm done playin'
Man I'm done sayin' that I'm done playin', I'm a start layin' into these
motherfuckering cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down, like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man, bowin' to his knees
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whao, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showin' you fuckin' old farts,
A whole other side, I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fuckin' marshmallow 
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, who's heart's Jello, 'cause

Shady Aftermath nigga, G Unit, rap juggernauts of this shit, we takin' over

Em Gee wilikers Gatman they got me surrounded
50 I'm on my way

I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a black bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed
They say Batman

50 Cent
Robin, Cagney and Lacey, it's 50 Cent and Shady
The worst baby, put your hands on my people I'll react crazy
Put a hole through ya front and ya back maybe
But dude if you try me, I'll have ya ass hooked up to an IV
I'll leave no witnesses when I ride B
You fuck with me, you'll see
I'll react like an animal, I'll tear you apart
If a masterpiece was murder, I'd major in art
Niggaz knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start
But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts whoo
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
And my cock back hollow tip in the chamber
Danger, anger will change ya
And make ya aim that and squeeze

I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man

Eminem
Motherfucker, you retarded you touch 50
I'll leave you dead, leave you dearly departed
We're walkin' away from a beef, in which clearly you started
I said we're walkin' away, did you hear me you wanna be thankful
That we ain't beefin' we're still breathin' and just leave it at THAT
Cause if me and 50 and G Unit hop back in that BAT mobile
It ain't gonna be no more rappin', it's gonna be BRAAAAT gunshot sound
Retaliation will be like them muslim Shi'ite ATTACKS
Some where along the line, its like me and 50 made a PACT
He's got my back, I got his, back
It's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins
Cause when we beef we pull each other in
to the bullshit like we're conjoined at the hip
It's just unavoidable some of this shit is washable
And some shit will never boil up
And some of it will just simmer at best
If left alone, we'll let it be so there won't be no sit downs
With no Ray Benzinos, there will no peace discussions with me
There ain't gon' be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fuckin' with me and I'll gladly quit fuckin' with you
Just spit ya sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentionin me and the machine or Jimmy Iovine and Dre and 50
or D Twizzie, Obie and just let it be or we'll be back with a

I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed

Nigga you get it twisted, you can get ya wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hustle, I get money, in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme, I'm plottin' in the county and I'm with it
You cross me and you gon' make a cemetery visit
That's gangsta, you know me I told it, cause I live it
Shell cases drop, when that chopper chop
Way up the block, get hit with copper tops
When drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run, call the cops
They say no, nigga's know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you I want it
Its not a game, perfect aim you feel the flame
Up against ya brain, man it's so hot I'll make ya wish it rained

I got a gat man
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed

S1 got the heat

Adam Levine
My, yeah, yeah, mm

My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
But there's no place to go ohh ohh
No place to go ohh ohh
And all the confusion, it's an illusion
Like a movie, I got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, hey

50 Cent
Yeah, '03 I went from back filthy to filthy rich
Man they emotions change so I could never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggaz get on, they turned around and spit
right in my face so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
Cause I'm not writin anymore, they not makin hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doin what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter, entrepreneur
Fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver, what's it to ya
The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my  Recovery , my comeback kid

Eminem
While you were sipping your own Kool Aid getting your buzz heavy
I was in the fuckin shed sharpenin my machete
Sippin on some of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready
to wolf down this spaghetti, or should I say this spa GET EVEN
Think you fuckin meatballs keep on just for getting
Thought he was finished, motherfucker it's only the be ginning
He's buggin again, he's straight thuggin, fuck who he's offending
He'll rip your vocal cords out and have them bitches plugged in the
motherfuckin wall with 3,000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end, dump them then plug them motherfuckers in each
one of your eye sockets cause I thought you might finally fuckin see
That'll teach you to go voicin your cocksuckin opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, FUCK letting up
You're gonna end up regretting you ever betted against me
Feels like I'ma snap any minute, yeah it's happening again
And I'm thinkin about the same, motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch BUT 50
Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
Swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody KNOWS
I'm trapped so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right into this bubble, uh oh guess it's bubble wrap
It's like a vicious cycle, my life is in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn out like it did
Feels like I'm goin  Psycho  again, and I might just blow my lid
Shit I almost wish that I would've never made Recovery kid
Cause I'm runnin in circles with

50 Cent
I haven't been this fuckin confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me maybe, maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it  3 a.m.  in the mornin like Shady
Psycho  killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire, liar liar
Tryin to say this ain't classic get your ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy now pick a casket
Dirt nap with the maggots, it's tragic, it's sad it's
never gonna end, now we #1 again
with that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it, this a gift, God given
like the air in the lungs of e'ry fuckin thing livin

50 Cent
When you're breakin it down, keep breakin it down
This is what it sounds like, when I'm breakin it down
Yeah I'm breakin it down
Man this is what it feels like, when I'm breakin it down
When you're breakin it down, keep breakin it down
It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
I'm hot man It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault

'Til the sun comes up, every night c'mon
We party and we party 'til daylight

Lil' Hennessy, a lil' juice and gin

'Til the sun comes up, every night
We party and we party 'til daylight

I'm hustlin hard homie I do my thang
You fuck with the paper then watch the hammer go bang
Now shorty I like the way she move them hips

50 Cent

You're so seductive you make me wanna touch it
I ain't got to tell you, you know I wanna fuck you
I'm feelin your style, you better watch me now
My tongue'll be in your mouth, my hands'll be in your blouse
When you get me aroused you put a spell on me
Man if I can't have you I'ma go crazy
I want you bad now and if you want me
Girl come to me now, I said come to me now

Eminem
Come to me now, you don't come to me now
Apple in your mouth, tackled on the couch
Shackled in the house, I'll be back in about
20 minutes or less, with my Hannibal mask
So when you wiggle around and giggle in that cage
I knew I couldn't wait to get you off that stage
From the moment I met you had to let you know
I just wanted to get you through my bedroom do'
You makin me feel like I'm in middle school still
You squeal like a little girl, you're pitiful, chill
We gon' fuck, I just popped this little blue pill
I shouldn't have to say it shorty you should know
I hope you really gettin into my creep show
Let me shit on your chest and if some pee comes out
Just guzzle it down, just guzzle it down

50 Cent
It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault

I come back bigger Bigger Stronger
Stronger And angry And angry

Yeah Look look I come from a different crew you fuck with me I'll get to you
A clip or two I'll cripple you just cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol pop a pussy drop, drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie mini moe, Nine, Trey pound or Forty fo'
Pick a strap then take the Mac the Hawk I stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains I know your name and where you rest I make a mess
The hollow tips will hit your chest you cough up blood till EMS
Come pick you up you know your fucked when you get on the stretcher
Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven
The system I done been through it there's nothin new done to me
They lock me up they let me out you seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals while they up in corrections
They come home get a Nine then commit crime in perfection
It's murder one they found a gun now they doin ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint the shit's goin terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it 

Man these are average raps, I'm keepin the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath clique
You pop off the top, it's like openin vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch yeah there's somethin to jack a batch in
Impregnated then chewed up the embryo sack with Mac 10s'
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back to back twins
That fetus is fallin out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratch the surface, llke my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fuckin backyard, still tryin to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searchin for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

Yeah, I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killin' so villainously
Still as maniacal on the night goin psycho as Michael Myers 
You know what we're like on the muthafuckin mic, so try us 
and you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers

It's operation time they got him hooked up the wires
Squeezin me bleedin wheezin breathin he half dead
He must ain't know but now he know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Led showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn
School of arts, truly y'all, you better learn learn

Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah homie, turn turn
I'm debatin, mutilatin the lady
You've been waitin for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicatin it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her, I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's I squashed her
I put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub

When I'm through with Ricky It'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk witness this shit end up nautious
Look deep in my eye see many many men die
I swing gemstars faster than Samurai

I love niggas I love niggas
Cause niggas are me
And I should only love that 'presents me
I love to see niggas go through changes Whoooo
I love to see niggas shoot through shit Did it again
And to all niggas that do it I love

B.I.G.
To all my Brooklyn Niggas
To all my Uptown You niggas understand
To all my Bronx It's war nigga
To all my Queensbridge I'll blow you away

Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's
Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out
That's real

We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga

Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop Watertown
Of fist skill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo doo stain remover
Ha hahhh, yo Chief, pass the Buddha

When I was young my M.O. was to go hand to hand
And even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I catch a new case, and tell her ass catch me if you can
Don't let your people fill you up wit octane I'm not playing
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North C. Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo ass off propa'
There's no place like home, New York   New York
I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really
Pussy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Every bootlegger you know, bump my shit, bitch

The Invasion Invasion yeah
Green Lantern the infiltration, we comin' yeah

Bridge: Eminem

Whoa, here we go, I shoulda known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later you little haters
Are too jealous of us to love us
You hate it G Unit made it and Obie's coming
D Tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach
50 percent of it's 50 cent
The other 50 percent of it's who's color of skin it is
But if you even considerin' taking our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it
I'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cause then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates to some other shit
Then I'm a flip, then I'm a get to
Stomping in my Air Force Ones
But you won't be able to tell
If it's two pairs or it's one
It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
You'd think Nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink
I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
Wit a pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggedy

We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label

Eminem

Looking like one of them putty cat dolls
Trying to hold my woodie back through my draws
Steps upstage didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, shes like yoo
I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase
No time to waste back to my place

And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

Eminem
You are now, listening, to the sounds
of Shady, and Alchemist
Alchemist, Alchemist

Got an axe and a duffle bag, couple of fags
stuffed in the backseat, muzzled and gagged
Wrapped in bubble wrap two lesbians up, couple Hustler mags
And I grab a Pez dispenser, fill it up to the max
with muscle relaxers, the governor of Alaska
She loves when I ask her, shove my Polaski
sausage up in her ass, huh, while we hover over Nebraska
shooting at the fuckin buffalo pasture
in the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster
She's screamin Grab my titties, Shady suck on those bastards
But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after
I'm a gigolo, but y'all look like a juggalo rapper
Every day man I just seem to get a little bit doper
Shit, back down, man I'd rather lick on a scrotum
And eat the fuckin Octo mom's pussy lips with some okra
while I watch, Whoopi Goldberg, sizzle with Oprah
While Rosie pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa
Get a boner, and play dick swords with the Jonas
Brothers; your motherfuckin mother's aroma's
like no other, I keep thinkin of her smothered in Somas

It's chemical warfare, drop bombs like Saddam
I'm bringin the drama, like Barack Obama
Playin Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots with the Octo momma
I'm vato loco homie, I cock those llamas
For chemical warfare

Eminem
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin
Any man plannin to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
so fast it'll look like an invisible man standin
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this here and you better inhale
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
is gettin takin advantage of like Monica Lewinksy Leave me alone
Came home in a frenzy, pushin a ten speed
Screamin to Aunt Peg AUNT PEG
with three spokes stickin out of my pant leg
Fuck a headache, give me a migraine 
Damnit I like pain AHH
and you should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowin you wack
You act up and I'm throwin you down a flight of steps
then I'm throwin you back up em
If they don't like the track, fuck em
The rap struck em harder then gettin hit by a Mack truck
and then backed up on
And any half assed known rapper to trespass
better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch Ding Ding
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly Hurry up man
I'm sicker than a Tupac dedication to Biggie
I'm free fallin feet first out of a damn tree
to stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building and get to the last step
and still have half left

EmBad.. the bad..

EmThe evil
R5Take the evil with the evil

Yea yea yea Dr. Dre up in here Y'all know what this is.
its what y'all been waiting for Funk Master Flex, Big Kap,
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby.
Yo Eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is baby

Eminem
I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if i only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket it aint latching, and can't lock it
so they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
before me, and just kept throwing they fucking selfs at it
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication
but this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation Come on
Anyway I got down with Dre What up 
The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, Fuck the Police
when you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth
fucking baby Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo
Hell yea I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't
cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative
Wanna Fight  I'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'mm juss high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites
Motherfuckers, Slim Shady

Dr Dre: Dr Dre
Eminem: I'm drunk pass the tec

Cause if I get locked up tonite
Then I might not come home tonite
DreKeep it moving Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is On

Eminem
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron AHH
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake
Dont get so bent out of shape 
cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me
cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up
and fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home
it hides in the stove Hello, where you at
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 De Grades
Hailey Jade, daddy loves you baby,
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady
You critics wanna criticize but couldnt visualize
individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing
and Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band aid over his mouth
and shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
or change cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it
but as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent
either that or booed, thats why I keep an attitude
and go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old

Dr. Dre
Fuck that, turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do echo

Make it, make it, make it, boy we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin
And what I need from 'em No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
Cause these others low key with the snakin, fakin
Everything lined up for the takin
And what I need from 'em No favors
No favors

What I need No favors
E'rything lined up for the takin
And what I need from 'em No favors

Big Sean
I'm about gettin the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell them point and shoot like camera crews in front of cameras too brrrt
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude
I'm like, niggaz took the flow but I'm still standin too
Thought I had the Midas touch and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons fuck 'em
I've been talkin to God like that's my therapist
I'm African American in America, I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30 so He must be hearin shit
Don don don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead; others get hit with the lead
From where they need a hand out but they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what I came fo'
Born in a world goin where they told me I cain't go
In my lane though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim fo'
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing dependin on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly
Never needed favors or apologies, that's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
the pictures we been paintin, my nigga
Connected to a higher power, how I know Cause I don't write this shit, I think it my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin like we hypnotized, watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the GOAT while we alive, when we die we gon' be the gods

Eminem
If she was flavor, I won't save her/savor
No taste buds, hoe, later
Fuck you lookin at, hater
I saw dem eyes/sodomize like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheatin classmate
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
when you get your fuckin ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, late means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically 30
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy, brainy and nerdy
Blatantly dirty, insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis, said I put her face in the furnace
Beat her with a space heater, a piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
... It may be disturbing
What I'm saying's cringeworthy, but I'm urinating on Fergie
Call Shady number 81, surely
I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap, state of emergency
The planet's havin panic attacks, Brady's returning
Matter of fact I may be deserving of a  Pat  on the back like a Patriots jersey
... Inexplicable stomach growl
From the  Pit  of it, like a fuckin Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous, tongue is foul
Shoot off at the fuckin mouth, like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun'll sound
and you'll  Get A round  like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo, and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth, and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The van, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner, go HAM, donut
Or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland hoe, and Philando
Hannibal on the  Lamb , no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government
handle a commando, your man don't want it
Trump's a BITCH I'll make his whole BRAND go under yeah
And tell Dre I'm meeting him
in L.A, white  Bronco  like Elway, speeding I'm
'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in
... Females stay beatin him
Bet you they'll lay bleeding and yell, Wait pleading but
screaming is pointless, like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving him pale faced, medium sized welt straight
treating him like a cellmate, seedy, I'm climbin hell's gate
Bitch I'm like your problems, self made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed
Cause I'ma

I know you're feeling yourself right now
But I'm not sure she's the one, I would call 'em in
Ay, I'm outside
What are you doing here

Yeah...huh...hip hop, hip hop, hip hop
Turn my mic up a little bit hip hop
Hit some of this Cali guidohip hop
Listen to some muthafuckin'... hip hop
Everybody got a little story they gotta tell
Niggaz ain't heard my shit...hahaha
The life of Bizarre...what

Hip hop, that's the way of life Word
If you think you're nice, then go grab the mic Grab it
Let me tell you my story, 'cause everybody got one
Grab a pen and pad and start to jot some
Always told myself that I would never be losin'
Man I ain't had no hood, my mother was always movin' Damn
From Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit C'mon
God damn, Mama, what's the point the fuck
So I would go in my room and pack my little bags Aughh
Jump in the truck with my step dad
When I was ten years old, I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older, man, the force got stronger Yeah
And me and my rap partner wasn't seein' eye to eye
So he picked up and started a group with some other guys Haha
This is hip hop...man, I won't stop
Yo Big Boi What up Gimme a beatbox

Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop

From the hip hop shop to Maurice Malone Uh huh
Ten years later, I'm still in the zone Word
7 Mile and  where a star was born Yeah
United we stand, divided we swore D 12
And hell yeah, I lived in my car Yeah
Bitch, I was homeless, I would have slept in a jar Hahahaha
And Dirty Management, I wish all the best
But me and my niggas, we had to do what's best That's right
It was a mess, all them taxes and accounts What
Checks started to bounce, niggas couldn't buy an ounce Hell yeah
And now that we platinum, they diss our name What
Like we won't go to the car and get them thangs
And beef, sometimes you don't have a choice
To the fight with Whitey Ford to the beef with Royce What
To the Ja Rules, Benzinos, and niggas in the club
To the e dubs and niggas you ain't heard of
And man, I don't know how to use a gun Naw
But I'll learn quick if the fuckin' beef come

Man, I thought this was supposed to be hip hop, hip hop
I'd rather be fishin' in flip flops, flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock, did, I
Can't see no country singers beefin' over some guitar
Riff that Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seger 
When I was younger I was so eager
To have a gun I would do the same
Couldn't wait to get to the shootin' range
Me and my man Goofy Gary just tryin' to let loose some steam
Muthafuckas laughin' 'cause I couldn't aim
So I'd pull the fuckin' target closer and just shoot the thang
I used to have this theory: keep three bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no CCW license
I tried to apply for one, they said it'd take 5 6 months
What the fuck am I supposed to do mean time when rivals come
Hide that sumbitch in the glovebox or inside the trunk
Now, back to what my three bullet theory was
I'm triple platinum, I ain't tryin' to catch no murder one
Figured I'd shoot to wound, probably miss with at least one
But them other two gon' fuck his shoulder and his kneecap up
Then I'ma say it's self defense, how come I had the gun
Was because I was at the range, on my way back from
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I'd get a year for each bullet at the most
As opposed to havin' a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety
But it gave me power, and it made me crazy
And psychotic, I just got retarded once I got it
Thank God it was empty the night that I got caught with it
What the fuck, man I thought that it was supposed to be...

Swift

And learn how to fuck like porno bitches do

Devin the Dude
When I was young I was sprung off the way women used their tongue
I couldn't nut yet, but fuck that, it was still fun
to look... I took... vaseline
Even though it was thick and rubbed it on my dick
Now I'm grown...
... and my bone is so well known hoes wanna get it cloned
Shit, ain't nothin wrong with you chunkin that monkey
All up on me 'til the whole room's funky
The negative thoughts, it's time to change
Shit, you a woman, I'm a man
It's all natural, and we're compatible
I'll bend you over, knock you down, slap that ass a little bit
ohh ohh But not to hurt
Like after havin a full course meal, it's the dessert
Now lay on your stomach, put a arch in your hips
and look back so I can see all four of them lips

Bizarre
I can on Superman drawers, I'm 6 years old
All in my room, all alone
I'm young, dumb, layin the pipe
Showtime, HBO, Friday night
Butt naked on the couch, without no clothes
Remote control, ready to bust a load
And fuck Roxanne, I want Big Ann
Tight old pants, my mother's best friend
I watch all your movies and your DVD's
I heard you're comin out with a porno CD
I want Janet Jacme, to smack me
Take your bikini off, get on the bed and attack me
I love porn, but niggaz be hatin
R. Kelly ain't got nothin on the shit I be makin I'm 14
I'm a freak, I been that way since 7
Me, Big Boi and Devin; bitch is 11

Big Boi
I like a lady, but I sure love a slut
The type that like to sit on my dick and let me scrub them guts
The chick that want it doggystyle while pullin on my nuts
And when you aimin for her face shorty don't be tryin to duck, uh
True Aquarian, mean I'm freaky as to fuck
Eat that coochie for an hour after you shower cock 'em up
From the power of the orgasm your legs are lockin up
Caught a cramp in your thigh, can't even pull your stockings up
But your spike leather collar plus stilletos lookin tough
Now you're passed out on your stomach, seems though you had  Enough 
like J Lo in that movie where her husband beat her up bitch
Puss appears to be pregnant, swole and wet up
Now you need to go on and get up 'fore I set up some more setup
I done caught my second wind, let's begin, lift your head up
It's the battle of the sexes, we can do this shit 'til breakfast
I don't want no mo' babies but I can give you a baby necklace

We ain't just shootin niggaz, we buckin bitches

Bizarre
My fully loaded nine will shoot through your metal door
Have ya nigga's far and out like white kids at grocery stores AHHHH
Battle Bizarre and it's just too deadly
Even a rapper with amnesia who met me still couldm't forget me
If I don't get all my fuckin dough
Y'all gonna see more fights and spits then the Jerry Springer show
Cause I'm a nasty, dirty, filthy bitch
For ten rocks even a basshead with AIDS would suck my dick
Cause I'm quick to snatch a nigga out his Polo
I'm the reason niggaz come ten deep and end up leavin solo
I'm by myself Meet losing ya'll niggaz must be buggin
We can battle for ten minutes and let your cousins be the judges
I'm the illest rapper to come out thus far
I'll shoot anybody; even the bitch who gave me CPR
Step to the Outz and end up getting burned
Fuck around and get raped like one of Bill Clinton's interns

Eminem
I'll shove a gun in ya grill, greasy and heated 
Smothered in hot mustard;
so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated while you breathin
or you'll be leavin the receivin room this evenin with Jesus
You hate on us and we'll be waitin on eight corners
Swarmin ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders c'mon
I hop in a jeep, slam on the gas and charge you 
and bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
Flotin around drowned face down in a boat damn
I'll pile five dudes in a pinto and pull up 
to the 7 Mile drive through at McDonald's and piledrive you
I got the power to snatch a motherfucker out of his car
when he drives by me at 90 miles an hour
This place is my house I might as well erase my face with white out 
cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows

Fuzz
I'm dressed to please sucking nips
Yeah, she get it the same way that I fucked the chick
Stuck my hands in her panties like bitch suck my dick
87 freak 187 heat the passion rolls I'm passin clothes
You like it in the ass is what I'm askin hoes
Aren't you Fuzz he has sold more albums then the Jackson's sold

I rode your ass and smoked take one pull and smoke your head up
I'll send you to tell 2Pac to Keep His Head Up
I went to the fighting really Canibus who can get up

Ran a couple more miles should have done more sit ups

Call your bitch like, Bitch, come and pick this bitch up
On battle you be sweeter then I get this shit up
I'll stomp you too you get up
Or stomp you to the cops come
Eighty nigga's came when your fucking block got dumb

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

Dreamin ohhhhh ohh ohh ohhh
Of fallin mm mmmmmmm
Dreamin ohhhhhhhhhh ohhhh
Of fallin ohhhhhh ohhhh

B.o.B
Yeah, yo, let's pretend like it's '98 '98
Like I'm eatin lunch off of Styrofoam trays yeah
Tryin to be the next rapper comin out the A A Town
Hopin for a record deal to ignore my pain
Yeah, now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane woo
Okay, and everybody know my name Bob
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest yup
Sellin out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

B.o.B
Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of bein a rapper
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes
Like I never used to run away into the blackness
Now, let's pretend like it was all good good
Like I didn't live starin in the notebook
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood
Yo, now let's pretend like I ain't got a name nah
Before they ever called me B.o.B or A.K.A. Bobby Ray
I'm talkin back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andr� 3000
Before I ever got on MySpace yeah
Before they ever noticed my face yeah
So let's just pretend, and make wishes out of airplanes

B.o.B   singing
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone, they're just memories
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone

Eminem
Ahem, aight
Let's pretend, Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend, things would've been, no different
Pretend, he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend, he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind, Marshall you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game, there ain't no way that you'll win
Pretend, he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You won't amount to SHIT, quit daydreamin kid
You need to get your cranium checked
You're thinkin like an alien, it just ain't realistic
Now pretend, they ain't just, make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the Rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explainin to Hailie and Lainey
these food stamps and this WIC shit
Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even here, he pretends that

There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it
And when will he stop
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just won't listen will ya, nah I guess not
You just can't can ya, man I can't stand ya
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us
Man when are you gonna let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

Holy toledo it's Angelina Jolie amigo
She told me yo Shady just hand your penis to me I'll deep throat
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we're gonna see bro
Who was a fantasy I don't mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna rassle I shove a fucking jar of vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed lexapro broken up wit the capsule or paxil
Just incase I ain't dope enough wit the raps though
Coke is cut with tobacco
Smoke it up then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a cocunut with tabasco
Shady let go, the hoe has been choked up enough
Let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
I used to love her hooters now Carmen Elektra cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I'm off my fucking meds but I'm on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mum in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jasons face while I vomit on Freddy Krugar
They can't even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I'm gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra 
cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew cuz

There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it
And when will he stop

B.o.B
B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up, geez
There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
Cause I will never lay down
And I will never let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

B.o.B
With the soul of a Sharman
I leave the beat than vomit
Like a bullemic woman with an uneasy stomach
I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
So can you hear me coming
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
It's probably go diseases on it
I'm just being honest, I can see the comments
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
Shit I just do this for the haters, I don't need the money
I diarrhea on track so it needs plunging
Somebody tell these girls please release my undies
Nobody really understands my language
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
But still I got a whole lot of patience
Sittin' back watching Earth from my Space station

There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it
And when will he stop
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just won't listen will ya, nah I guess not
You just can't can ya, man I can't stand ya
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us
Man when are you gonna let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

Eminem
Oh my gosh I put Natasha Bendingfield in a washer
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
Its like I got ya hypnotising like I gotcha
I gotcha pychologically fucked
Michael would like an apology what
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I'm as cold as a muthafucking icicle on my nut
I aint nuttin' nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post tramatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic I've been in a while
This is the closest that its come to the Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I don't paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fannings front door while the whore is tanning
He can't say whore
Of course he can, man he just saw her fanny then murdered her
while he danced around the room and wore her panties

There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it
And when will he stop
Shady man I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just won't listen will ya, nah I guess not
You just can't can ya, man I can't stand ya
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us
Man when are you gonna let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

Nigga I wear fur coats in the summer nigga
Wife beaters in the winter, damn
Uh, shit

Boogie
Yo yo, aw man

I can't send out no message to none of my exes and bitches as friends ay
I can't blow it again, need a bitch that's as thick as my skin
Shit, cause

Eminem
I left my legacy hurt Fuckin absurd
Like a shepherd havin sex with his sheep, fuck what you heard/herd
All this talk in my ear, I got a idea, like the clerk when you're tryna buy beer ID ya
Since on the mic, I'm a nightmare
Fuck it, I thought this might be a good time to put woke me to rockabye
I got the bottle of NyQuil right here right here
You want the sleep me to wake, you want Slim Shady EP
that's on the CD cover, sockin my mirror sockin my mirror
I promise not to cry crocodile tears crocodile tears
If you end up shocked at my lyrics shocked at my lyrics
Marshall is dead in the water but not that I care
Dre said Rock the boat and the Doc/dock is my peer/pier
So, it's unanimous you're at attention
The planet's listenin and their banana splits again, which has its advantages
But when you got nothin to say except for the hand your dick is in
And if your plan's to stick it in Janice Dickinson
Imagine if the Temazepam is kickin in, it's havin you panic stricken
You're trippin off of tryptophan and tripped a fan in Switzerland
Just for askin to autograph a picture, then ripped it in
half and whipped it at him and kicked his ass all the way back to Michigan
But no matter how many, rounds
or, if I get knocked down in a, bout
and fell to the ground, I got a, fighter's men 
tality, I'll get back up and fight with it
In fact I'm a ttackin the, mic with it
I'll make it sound sound sound like a vampire's bitin it bitin it
But I'd have to be Dracula's sidekick sidekick
to be down for the  Count  haha
Yeah... yo

Pow pow wow woo I don't huh see no uh clouds nah

I've been thuggin through my rainy days, for days rainy days, uh
I ain't really tryna hang today, today hang today, uh
I need changes in a major way, a way major way, uh
I just pray I never fade away, away

Guess who's back
Mommy We're home
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill
Everybody Put your hands where my eyes can see

Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
Fourty fifty Samoans, they knowing when D Bo was
50, Tweezy, Obie there won't be no hoe in us
They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
The noise from  be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
Till the club closes, and clears out
And that's when they see you flatened
Nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
It ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off

Shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the K's get to scream
Hip hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip hop is in a state of 911

Step off my holster cause shit it's getting serious
All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
How long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us
Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Allusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon

Uh, gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On this shit you call hip hop, this function is where did it
When I   put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you   stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
When you   enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit
We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
All these   imitators parading like they some playas
Trying to   save hip hop the task is something greater
Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding a   gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a   full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

Yeah Guess who it is
Aiyyo Dre I think they in trouble WOO
Scott Storch Why you have to do it like this to them
Feels like a new day

Listen, now every time I come and I hit you niggaz with shit regardless
You get retarded and then the niggaz ain't got a clue
On how the fuck I do what I do and say what I say
And spit what I spit you ain't never even gotta question who
Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that can ever come
And spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin zoo
Then I come and I spit all crazy sh sh sh shit
And m m m make n n niggaz do exactly what I want 'em to
From my point of view instead of trying to step up
you still trying to play catch up and keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggaz panick and freakin get schizophrenic and let they emotions out
And I doubt they can ever test my crew
Take a second check it I wreckon my records are better than
Whatever record you recorded that's why ya shit is through WOO
You fuckin idiot I don't think you get it
I'm one of the greatest ever period every syllable is true

Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision
I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort
You niggaz can never ever really fuck with me
Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll

Shit on a mic and do do, my doo doo
You do not have a fightin chance to move you you were covered in my poo poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid do do do do do do
G g g goobers secluded you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do do you
So just sit back and watch somethin you just gon have an a chew
You just made me sneeze I'm allergic to beats like these
Please excuse me my allergies are actin up thanks a lot Scott
Your probably wonderin why there's thunderin everyone
Is runnin and duckin up under everything up on the block
Cause Bus a Bus and Flipmode just tip toed into the club
With shady quietly tryin not to start up a riot with Doc
But since we always started we might as well have a party
So gather 'round everybody come on lets get our drink on
And you ain't got to do nothin special for this occasion
Just reach in the closet put somethin on and get to the club

Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision
I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort
You niggaz can never ever really fuck with me
Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll

Catch you niggaz and snatch you niggaz you bunch of bumblin fools
Who got me rumblin dudes all way down the block
Keep on stumblin and jumblin over their words and vowels
Throw in the towel see you niggaz is on the clock
And you runnin out of time see I'm tired of all y'all
M m m mumblin m m mumblin n n nigga I got it locked
Every single time you put my shit in your cd player and turn up the volume
You bang your head because your shit is not
I   continue with crumblin niggaz and tumblin niggaz
You struggle while I humble a nigga with the glock
Then I watch you while I'll keep on fumblin while I got you tr tr tremblin
For one of my niggaz bust ya head with a rock
Before I start to do another thing then to make you crown me the king
With such a butter swing nigga follow the flock
Now watch my brotha bring all my diamonds to summer bling
while I'm climbin and fuck her then tell you bitch to get off my yacht

Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision
I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort
You niggaz can never ever really fuck with me
Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll

Teats and Thurston Howell, and yelling Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerve purse with badly disturbed nerves
You wanna be the one to step up and get served first
99% of aliens prefer Earth
Come here to rule the planet, storm on your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
With smeared letters, runnin together and blurs spurts
Hang with male shovenest pigs and perverts
I point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerbers
My first words were bleep bleep and curse curse
Never had shit and I still don't deserve dirt
My breath still stinks, and I'm on my third cert
Digging out my stitches, and hollering nurse nurse
You said this shot would numb me this shit just hurts worse

Slim Shady
Cali Kings
Baka Boys

D12
War Lab, call us haters all you want
Fuck it call me a hater, full blown instigator
Leavin niggaz on intubators breathin like Darth Vader
I hate people that pack guns but they don't bust 'em
Or bitches that come back to my room but they ain't fuckin
Pistol clutchin, the Dozen, you heard it don't get is misconstrued
Whatever we do'll hit the news once we get the tools

Eminem samples
You're an emcee and you mention my name
in the wrong way, and you draw first blood, I'm comin

Canibus
You pushed D 12 to the side to sign Voltron 5
If Proof was alive, he'd be dying inside
You ain't no hip hop messiah, you a bitch cause you dissed Mariah
Shit like that supposed to be private
I'ma fry you on behalf of Mariah and Michael
Put you back on them drugs, make you suicidal
You can't shut the record down, nigga it's viral
When you use the word nigga, just remember your idols

DZK
I got a question, I'm white, can I join D12
I'll sell you four million records then I'll tell you go to hell
Leave Swifty in charge, then remove all the stars
And make the group wish Bizarre shot pool in a bar
An assault lawyer stop the beat, suing us all
I really do hope you know who get involved
Cause I'm a fan and I'll get you for a Nick Cannon dissin
And you already know how fuckin sick Canibus is
I hate a bitch ass nigga just as much as I hate fags
I love goin to war but I hate when they raise the flag
These niggaz hittin the streets spittin venom on me
Then start renegin the beef, I hate peace treaties
Forever yo' enemy I increase beef as Amityville's finest
Cause I don't believe in stoppin violence
I'm a tyrant that'll snatch my respect and scram
I use a uzi cause I hate a Tec when it jams
I hate when dudes treat this like life a movie
Usin rap as his excuse to do shit and they only move ki's in the booth
I piss on niggaz hands, whoever's grown, patches and tombstones
I hate 'em ass when I break into a home
I'm barefaced, I clap your cat, ramsack it
That's what I'm wearin black and I hate goin out the back
So call me a hater, walkin detonator, I ain't afraid
to stick this blade into your fade in front of spectators

more Eminem dialogue
You're an emcee, big small it doesn't matter
No matter how big I get, I just want people to know

Canibus
You the devil in a red dress on MTV
You signed more black people than a basketball team
What you tryin to say subconsciously You can't rock the beat like me
Consciously you know I rock you to sleep
Slim Shady you a coward cause you scared to rap with me
The only black man you respect is 50
And the greatest rapper of all time was dead right
You Dead Wrong, you shouldn't have even been on that song

DZK
He fell off so hard this faggot broke his accent
I'm flippin through the channels seein Bruno get his ass sniffed
And I'm disgusted man, what the fuck is wrong with you
Why'd you date Mariah Mariah's not a fuckin dude
You never even saw her nude and you busted two
Must have been thinkin 'bout your stepdad touchin you
But that ain't nothin new, I asked your ugly crew
They verified it, so bitch quit lyin

Canibus
I remember the first time we met, I ain't even liked you
Walkin around my video set like you was in high school
It must excite you seein black people being tribal
That's why Dr. Dre signed you
I bet you right now you got a big rotten Rosenberg beside you
Trying to be just like your father, inside you
Your Stan android fanboys need to kill that noise
I know what you thinking, kill that boy

DZK
We leavin Elvis funny money makin pelvis shattered
Let's see you square dance now, let's see you hold your bladder
Let's see you fire back Em where's the fire at it
Suicide hotline time, go dial that
Put on that 8 Mile hat and write a vile track
Get at some people that can actually diss you back
No more target practice on retarded actors
and pop stars, Marshall you're not hard

Eminem dialogue again   repeat 3X
Whatever happens to me in this game
I've always got my ear to the street

Canibus
Renegade, schmenegade you pink like lemonade
I've been better than you before Genesis was made
You ain't better than Black Thought, you ain't better than Mos Def
You ain't better than Canibus, Professor Griff Hotep
So renegade, schmenegade you pink like lemonade
I penetrate through Hailey's Comet with metal blades
Yeah You and I both know why I'm sayin this
I hope Whoo Kid, get fired for playin this

Bizarre
Get off, Nikolai Volkoff, mazeltov
Ready to show off, fo' fo'll blow your do' off
Blowin off steam, goin off the beam
Let the 9 sing, bitch this ain't a dream
Bitch I'm the king, color me bad
Skinny jeans, what happened to the sag You makin me mad
Y'all a bunch of JJ Fags, now who the fuck is bad
Motherfucker I'm bad
Call me a hater

Eminem Speaking
Most people don't see how much work is really involved 
in this rap shit
I didn't know it
I didn't see it
I never saw it until i was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
To understand what its like
But you always gotta 
People always gotta see your smile
You always gotta put on that fake
You know what i'm sayin
No matter what u just been through

B Real
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large a big house 
5 cars, you're in charge
Comin up in the world 
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

B Real
I remember the days when i was a young kid growin up
Lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up
To rock crowds make money
Chill wit the honies
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shits funny
How impossible cream manifest in the games that be comin with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears 
and losin some of your peers
And losin some of your self 
Music has past gone by
Hopefully you don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac in the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shits deep
48 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill
But never will 
Till he crosses over still
Feelin no hate 
But  fantasies come wit these
Just to sacrifice the taste of makin cheese
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games 
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play
Trapped in what you rappin about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The rout you took started collapsing 
No fans
No fame
No respect
No change
No women
And everyone shits on your name

So you wanna be a rap superstar 
And live large
A big house 
5 cars 
The rent charged
Comin up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house 
5 cars 
The rent charged
Comin up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

Noreaga Speaking
When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign  your life over
And these whiteboys don't care about you
Cuz the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone n Noreaga
And they'll find another B Real
So you  need to just keep 
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while your hot
And mafuckin get out the game
Stick to the drug game
And the drug game is even worse
Because if someone jerks you 
You can shoot em and kill me
But in this game if someone jerks you
You gotta be humble

Eminem Speaking
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything gotta be all good
When you see someone slap hands with em
You know what i'm sayin give em a pound
Or whatever it is
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit

B Real
My own son don't know me
Sittin up in the hotel room lonley
But I thank god I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
Cuz they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by sony
I'm in the middle like monie
And the press say that
My own people disowned me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at the paladium
Who just wanna cling on swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar 
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started gettin ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This ain't easy take it from weezy 
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They talkin evil

Bust it rugged, shine like a gold nugget what they know about this
When I bust on the mic, I bust a real hard rhyme    > Keith Murray
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it what they know about this
When I bust on the mic, I bust a real hard rhyme    > Keith Murray

I'm rockin shit, packin shit, while stackin shit
If anyone steps up askin shit, I'm blastin shit
You gone phase me, but swingin like Peter Parker
Motherfuck the shop, I'll wreck the Goddamn barber
Forget your dreams about being with fans hugged up
You couldn't be a dope MC if you said his rhymes drugged up
I told you once, but you forget so here's a flashback
You couldn't be shit, if you came out my asscrack
Stop frontin kid, you know you ain't paid
And the only mic/Mike you wrecked was that kid you fought in first grade
Ain't nothin lyrical about you but your lies
So cut the shit, cause its startin to draw flies
You're played like my five year old's newborn toys
Don't know shit about Chicago, but I could still make Illa Noyz
Like Robin Leech I display stylish ways
Thats rough like my face when I haven't shaved in days
Listen up, all these words take heed
When I cock and squeeze, no more MC's breathe none
I'm sick of this, here's my final diss
Fuck you dumb niggaz you ain't shit like piss

Eminem
My Smith and Wessy got you layin in some alley messy
Got your family lookin for your ass on Sally Jesse
We squash beef in the mo', when you ain't breathin no more
Leavin your skull split like Steven Seagal
Let the cat out, flat out, Detroit's a mad house
So I don't get offended when I hear my city badmouthed
We quick to pull the gat out and set it
And leave you with more shit missin than a Lil' Kim radio edit
Stick up kids be tryin to live paid
You get your grill sprayed with twenty seven bullets in your ribcage
Get the guage, cock it back, empty your pockets, Jack
Or I'ma send you flyin like a rocketpack
Murder you for a bag of chips and a chocolate snack
Break into your crib still your shit and lock it back
Ten year old kids be standin on the block with gats
Just for livin nowadays'll get you flocked with bats
Where I'm from...yaknow what'm sayin, that's some old Detroit shit
y'all wouldn't know about that shit, though. Less you come
to my city, ya know what'm sayin See where we live, 
cause we shine

Hush
MC's put Detroit up in they rap songs
Cause without us there careers wouldn't last long
So like a generation we've been passed on
Now its our time to shine, put your glasses on
Got these A & R's and labels with binoculars
Lookin in, jockin us and not jockin yours
Too many groups follow trends, unoriginal
Usin loops that transcend every bitch in you
Don't ever try to say this is a ghost town
One million rappers in this bitch, they need to slow down
Evualute the situation, all the rest are killers
Fly hoes out on Jefferson with the drug dealers
Two years in the joint, nobody's touchin Hush
Try to say you'll put us down, but your under us
Now who the fuck are you its just coincidental
When your rhyme your even worse than the instrumental
Your just a phone tapper with no backbone
Talkin shit, I got a clique that only pack chrome
Have your ass gone, nowhere to run, when we hit
Next time you'll think twice of who you fuckin wit

Proof
Yo, ay yo turn the heads and the mics up
We got the Dreadknaughts, you know what I'm sayin
Super MC, you know what I mean
Bugz, Dirty and all that, all that shit
You know what I'm sayin, Desperados with the cars, Eminem

Eminem
Chauvinist pig, droven this Big Lincoln
Till it went over the bridge
Jumped out and dove in the ditch
Broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and fridge
Kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids
I'm going for your mids
Here's a body blow for your ribs
While you're clutching your stomach and bleeding all over your bitch
I know where you live, your girl showed me your crib
Unless she told me a fib
Then I'm gonna have both y'all get did
Burning incense, facing a murder sentence
Under intent, for investigation for killing infants
While I sit in padded rooms doing shrooms
Having visions of dead pregnant women with brooms jammed in their wounds
Slit your carpet and rugs, and fucked your apartment up
Sticking up all the drugs, and jumping in garbage trucks
I'm from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps
Give you a kidney punch, and mug you to get me lunch
See me every summer, layin up against the dumpster
With a one hundred dollar jumper, smothered in southern comfort
Got my Slim Shady sticker on your mother's bumper
She came home screamin a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her

Proof
Ay yo
Pursue to list em, there's no need to diss em
They be beheavin, make sure your whole breathing system
Twist them like big caps, who wants to hear that
Rap, murder rates, and I snap vertebrates 
Collapse further states, my tribe reserves the grave
Your pack deserve a crate, in fact the word is fake
I'll cook you slow like egg sufficient nuts
I'm holding vandanna like seven great molested sluts
Calling me a bitch nigga, you need to stop
Reality, one on one how many times you got dropped
I'm cut throat when any track runs, I smack none's
It's the rough method that makes Muslims run and pack guns
I'm volcanic, the sermon preacher
Burning MC's most wanted by Herman Kefa
You tried to get a squad, they was like oh no
Leavin you brain dead, hittin trees with Sonny Bono
I kick without a dojo, D 12 slow flow
Shoot down your mother ship and pimp slap mojo
No pro wanna go knuckle blades with renegade
Nigga tried to go pop, and plus they minute made
My lieutenant spray your brigade, and trampled your flow
Big P, the reason MC's canceled their shows
The truth will hurt, see Proof will work your shame in it
The best part of your show is when you put my name in it
My squad, godly, fearin shit hardly
So I hope when I die, I dope like Chris Farley
Fuck that

Bugz
Who run shit, watch these drums hit
You dove head first into some old dumb shit
Here's a can of ass whip, for you to come get
Your clique made their trip, I made them hoes submit
Ask your girl, she knows the scoop don't fuck with Bugz bitch
I'll chop off her titti, have you sucking one tit
Them pink belly niggas is who you run with
Making half ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate your damn sound, don't like it one bit
You can make a double album, won't have one hit
Your entire outfit is on some bullshit
And there's not a damn one that I can't out wit 
I admit, that my style is unfit
For mamma's baby boy because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit arsony, get harm quick
You pull the alarm switch, I'll stab you in your armpit
Now who the nitwit wanna come get with
This egotistic, hip hop fundal mentalisitic
Don't risk it, you'll get your shit split
Now keep your distance, and keep existence
I'm the persistent when it comes to bench shit
I smoked a blunt with my judge before my sentence
I'm relentless to deny you're senseless
Yo bitch, pay my bill that's where the hell your rent went
Fuck that

Almighty Dreadknaughts
I killed competition, with no way out as an opposition
Execute the passengers on the flight my executive decision
Then reminisce on how shady the business 
Terrorists asked by Israelis when they visit
Bombed in insentient
One word in three in the making, murdered the exhibition team finish
Beat the ref senseless
No timeout extended play papers over your intermission
And increasing the battlefield with the blood of Christians
Cryin for the messiah, but he don't listen
I pop my wing when I top the stove frame boil sizzling
I fight a maniac cook, I do damage to kitchens
Fuck Home Depot, I demolition
When I home improve, I'll be there to fix it
For my school is supervision, for down finical aid smoked up my intuition
Only hang out with rappers with explicit lyrics
And pistol grip punks with a beef, bitch do you wanna get eaten

Almighty Dreadknaughts
I got a mind full of troubles 
Everything is in doubles
I buy my guns in couples
No time to replace fumbles
Cause MC's come and MC's go, we both flow
Injured from head to toe
No fit a model, we full throttle
You stuck in low, incapable to master flow
Everything is tactical, living mathematical
Watch master flow, unleash and let go
I shit like lava, original designer, married to marijuana since a minor
Making it a chance to see my battleship could get you wet like fibs, what
Applying death defying feets, maintain to keep my peace
Flow like to see, when I release these beats over concrete

Almighty Dreadknaughts
My president transitions has taken place
As eyes spread folk ally on the M I CR O
Power he's cyphin not quality, I deal it
Lays the track and made it real, I know my people feel it
Keep their head bobbin, and the emotional sobbin
Plus a cultural cipher after show, hoes be slobbin
Knobs, love the fuckin flavor of the icing
Plus I'm precision, my double edge will continue slicin

You Have Agreed, Not To Try This At Home. Anything Else

Proof
Who am I
I'm a basterd, I stolen off ya and blast at ya
Smokin' more blacks than the part time wars in Africa
I'll  out the martyrs for beef
Rest in piece alot of you reef designing your greef
By snatchin' your brother, smackin' your lover
Paralizing your cousins, smokin' your mother's husbands
A dozen chosen showguns to shotguns
Roll up on you with no guns but still pop one
I bomb like napalm from the curb to your house
And Please God the last words out ya mouth
No affiliates, just dogs and troops
Most lyin' death than this morgue and roots
All we choose to beef, I bring spatulas
Flip it and throw it back at ya, so bring your gat with ya
Spectacular murder manufacturer, fuck binacular
Only heaters talkin, I'm trappin ya just to flattin ya
Hop in the accura, roll up on the back of ya
Chill out in 5, and then them niggaz act alive
I smoke branches from off the tree tops
I hang with real niggaz, PA's, PK's and Pete Rock
Y'all niggaz with pre ops, spill blood and Reeboks
Don't discriminate blastin rookies on the e box
Your streetforce envolves just for excitement
Like if you wasnt you never heard of enditement
I sum it up quick so that you can understand me
Fuck you, your crew, your bitch and your whole family

Bizarre
Bizarre's a villin, bitch I ain't illin
I'll pull your fucking head off while your ass is winddillin'
Go heads the triggers of the penot scott villian
Vericons march, atleast shoot a million
Dirty Dozen the first week at least a billion
If not, it's back to robbing and stealin'
Bizarre's the illest, the shitty is the worst
And what's the worst is I don't give a damn
Offer Garth Brooks a stolen grand am
Come to your record label, take all your doe
Take your rap name and have your manager booking you shows
I don't gove a fuck if we don't get along
Bitches know my name without the Slim Shady song, bitch..

We in this bitch with DJ Butter
Who gives a fuck
We in this bitch with Wallstreet and we don't give a fuck about nothing

You Have Agreed, Not To Try This At Home. Anything Else

Royce Da 5'9
Yeah yeah..
What's my motherfucking name Royce Nickle Nine
A messiah of all, much higher than y'all, undeniably raw
Quick to blow the fuck up and reform again
The bomb threat re occured, re warn your men
I promise you get toared up and re torn again
Not one slur or word will be re born again
As long as the shit cracks and they turn a loop up
I spit it until it's pitch black and burn the roof up
Better step the fuck up for the shit getting spit
Turns to whips getting lit, turns to tick tick tick
Niggaz be rapping just for the clubs, just for the love
That hit you had in the club sound like shit in the truck
That's why I love that nigga X, cause he raised my brow
With every rhyme, without having to take my style
It'll be a cold day in hell when these two soldiers lay in hell
Talk to me

Billy Nix
Billy Nix, I'm really sick of this silly shit
Rappers, get on the mic, swearing they're really spit
But you really fake, tough guy stop at your thirty eight
Drop your gloves and get taped, stop with your murder rate
Alot of kids listening to you
Wishing they you, wishing they was in a position with you to piss on their crew
Buttfuck all your sickness, we got the medicine
I'd rather piss on the capital, shit on the president
X Government, still flowing, still showing
I know where you niggaz come from, know where you niggaz going
We was all raised in the same dangerous cell
Understand I ain't a stranger to hell, I just don't like it
Rappers say the same thing getting retired
So I write something I like and pray that you bite it
Take an old gangsta rapper and make him retire
Take a young conscious rapper and keep him inspired
Black man, where you at man, take a stand
They taking this rap shit like they took our land
Fuck America that's right, you ain't hear me stutter
Wallstreet, Dirty Dozen with DJ Butter

Swifty McVay
I remain fatter than gluttony
Tapin bombs to the back of record companies
Blow 'em up if they ain't want me
The National Guard, they scared to hunt me
I love beef; I got you hoes duckin me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggaz in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if ya wanna biatch
It's this lyrical piranha 
Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes endin up in a fuckin mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screamin
Keep the motor on then I'm leavin I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you
I don't give a fuck about you or your car

I'm a alcoholic, with the fuckin toilet

Bitch shut your fuckin mouth
I'ma keep eatin 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house
with a chain saw to cut me out me out, me out
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
Too busy fuckin wit your twelve year old baby sitter hahaha
And all women ain't shit   only good for cookin, cleanin 
And sucking dick and thats it I said it
I was responsible for killin John Candy
Got Jon Benet Ramsey in my '98 Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody; truly yours the idiotic Bizarre

Eminem
My adolescent years weren't shit 'til what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignorin the shit how borin it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwin a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Its they who rapped me and say they can take me
It's they who legs I brake and make achy
It's they who mistake me and make me so angry
I'll shit on you I'll spit on you 
Start pissin and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin, I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spillin my guts like chicken cordon blew and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch 
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants downward

Kon Artis
Is Richard Pryor still alive
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dying what
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang it
Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with
I hang you up naked by your ankles danglin oww, oww
My need I stay stranglin, I don't need your help
If you gon' give me the pussy
I'll un loosen my belt I'll shit on you
I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest

Kuniva
Yo it's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk 
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
Hey, hey, hey I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like D Bo fightin Peablo Bryson I'll shit on you
So what you hollerin and yellin about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fuckin skeleton out
Niggas get hit wit a two piece; bling bling
Wit a poisonous sting, I'm such a violent thing

Proof
It doesn't show, when I choke you with shotguns
Roll up on you with no guns and still pop one
I bomb like palm from your curb to your house
Please God the last words from your mouth
No affiliates, just dawgs and jewels
Most flying death were smoging booze
All who choose to beef
I'll bring spatulas, flip it and throw it back at ya
So bring your gat with ya, spectacular
Murder manufacturer fuck immacular  
Only the heathens talk when I try to get to flatten ya 
Hop in an Acura, roll up on who got your back in a
Sliced them up then ya niggas start to act alive
I smoke brandish right off the treetops
Hang with real niggas PA's, PK's, and Pete Rock
Ya'll niggas in pre op, spill blood on Reeboks 
Don't discriminate blasted wookies on the Ewok 
Ya'll street forces survive just for excitement 
Like if you was if you never heard of indictment
I sum it up quick so you can understand me
Fuck you, your crew, your bitch, and your whole family

New tecs and calicos
Word has it we move mathematic on rappers
Who don't add up, you get broke, battered and slapped up
8 million stories in the nekkid call yo man Method
Straight guerilla iller nigga kill a murder record
My verbal shooter does it to ya
The 16 bar Ruger, bustin' yo funky dope manuevers
But I'm not ya Super Lover Cee, I'm the Super Sperm
Splash it on your skin rub it in like it's Lubriderm
10 out of 10 I'll be the...
Men of all men I mean the...
Creme de la creme a schemer...
Sippin' on 'Gnac and Zima...
True professional 2...

Eminem
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
Why I keep on duckin' under the bed when I hear thunder
Cuz I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people
To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby
I like that  I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, there'll be just as many muthafuckin' murderers
And heroin users without Marlilyn's music
But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it
Now the parents are suein' cuz little Darren is screwin'
Karen and Susan cause I told him to do it on Clue's new shit
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up
Cuz of me  Two 12 year old girls is knocked up
My attitude's 'fuck it' like Pac's was at one point
Wanna come join  Pick up a glock and just point
Now everybody's killin' everybody and everybody's bloody
And I'm just laughin' like it's funny
Cause I don't really give a shit about no muthafuckin' body
I'm so muthafuckin' nutty I don't give a fuck about nuttin'

Royce
My wrist is...water and freeze
And mix this is...audio Jesus the repent shit gets big
Keep it sharp like knife in a pop device
So Duro you gotta let it bump, I came from a hard knock life
They say this kid be rude like this can't be true 
I suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed
Vampire, sun go down I'm still wylin'
Bullets travel through the air in the night like Phil Collins
Rock City baby knife through your throat 'til you're broke
Rise from the underground like sewer smoke
It's all shifty, I got all a my dogs wit' me
And they all rich, and still all a they palms itchy
We'll pump, rumble over birds jungle urge
Walkin' like we talkin' drunk while we stumble over words

Method Man
It's just...Mr. Meth and DJ Clue
I ain't crazy, I just do what the beats say do

Eminem
It's just...Slim Shady and DJ Clue
I ain't evil, I just do what the beats say do

I ain't bad, I just do what the beats say do..unnh...

Eminem
Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Mom wouldn't take me, the bitch still hates me
One day she said, Go rake leaves, I said, Make me
I'm proud to announce i was probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on going
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, Please fix me
Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince
And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then
I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta this fake shit school and rhyme
Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
Break shit

scratched 4X:
No...you hear me You go to hell

Parl Yams
Yo, y'all rappers have never learned
That's why I'm fuckin wit y'all
Run around telling niggas they can fuck wit Parl
I bring it to your high school, smoke the prom
Put your brother in a headlock, choke your mom
Cause any horror like a play off loss in game seven 
Walk around ripping on niggas madder than James Evans
My left hand's sharp it moves freestyle ultra
Slap my dick like Kool Keith
Fuck like you stole from me, and rules the streets
I don't wanna have to fuck you up, so cool cease
Parl Yams be the chosen thug
What I spit be cold juice like a frozen hug
Run the streets while you're stuck at home
My temper like Bushwick Bill, bitch leave me the fuck alone
I've been jealous since niggas was windmillin'
These cats just started to rhyme, my pen's spillin'
Your moms just told me to act, I've been wheelin'
So boy just slow your deck, i've been stealin'
I wet rappers cause it's me and Em
I guess I just ain't give a fuck like Eminem
Burglarize take busts with the slugs
Come in your window like    and bustin' your club
Put the heat up I teach them niggaz what to suck
And my young lords, when to stand up and light the Dutch

scratched 4X:
No...you hear me You go to hell

Eminem
I came to my last show with a horse swingin' a lasso
Drunk with the asshole ripped out of an old bathrobe
Cause I don't give a fuck, you better understand that
Two Zantacs, I don't give a fuck where SoundScan at
Billboard, drugs is what I kill for
I'm Happy Gilmore, just slip me anything in pill form
I may mingle but I plan to stay single
Play bingo and drink, get old and watch my face wrinkle
Sike, I'm 24 Thursday; six more birthdays 
and I'm blowin my brains out when I'm thirty
As long as my heart beats I'ma keep tryin to see
How much speed I can eat before I fall the fuck asleep
So I'm the Rapper, He's the DJ
I'm the one thats got the six year old nephew screamin F/U/C/K
So Jeff, give me a scratch scratched: No
The rest of y'all can kiss my ass 'til your lips stick to my pants

scratched 5X:
No...you hear me You go to hell

Tony Yayo
Yeah You riding with the talk of New York, Tony Yayo
Shady Aftermath and Soul Assassins, here we go

Niggaz, know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
You could run your mouth I don't care
But if you get to close I'm gon' clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is a last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day

Obie Trice
Niggaz when I step up in a bar, faggots wanna loot
like you muh'fuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gon' stand here as a man and
let some queer ass, funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggaz vibes
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggaz we leave early cock back surely
Open up your fade your grade brain meets Motor City pave'
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
Hoes and animals skirts get murked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you to play the bar hard
Trust in God cause youse about to get catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from who you be with
A 4 5 that'll light niggaz up and this 4 5 high make not give a fuck

Lloyd Banks
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty make your ass bet on words
Touch niggaz in jail make them wanna finish they last sents'
They say you live by the gun, you die by the next nigga gun
If thats the case then get a bigga one
You don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out the hood
That's a stereotype like everybody that's black and jumped
I'm in the white mink the fabric is done
Got rings like Mike, Bird, Magic, and them
Out of Dallas to the palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm in the cloud you don't see me on the trains
I travel first class you aint even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name cause I aint going back and forth
Your boss and your captain soft

Eminem
Cause we gon' bring it to anybody who want it
You want it  You gon' get it
Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
we gon' fuck you up with 'em
I got to much momentum moving in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step to them Broom
You know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
G Unit, D 1 2 and Obie we all move like assassins
Ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers, my vato will have you shot though
Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario
Little sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real
We burn Source covers like fuckin Cypress Hill
Did in the 90's when you was in diapers still
Shady Records you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough secondhand to make my fucking P.O. choke
I'm an OG, your fucking with a G.I. Joe
Bia Bia, mia mio a vida loco
I'm a pyscho Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spittin baby food on people
A tent siged on her ranch huddle up next to her
with Hello Kitty slippers on, humpin her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back or your shit pushed in
I put my blade in you like a fuckin pin cushion
slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Hen dawg
I'll show you to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco ese
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Shay... D and the 'D' is for deez nuts
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months
I'm having an E party for Easter please come
Cause we 

50 Cent
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it you want you gon' get it
To much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gon' fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a twelve gauge Mausberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around you know how I get down
I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before it ends cause the bad guy die
If you tryin to buy guns from a nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on them they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fend to touch some
When I raise my knife shit I fend to cut some
See I walk like Ron O' Neil but talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me

50 Cent Sorry Kim
Eminem  Oh Sorry, Oh

Eminem   Soul Assassins y'all, what up Muggs
DJ Muggs What up Em
Eminem   We outta here...

Thirstin Howl
I hit harder than Foreman
landing both both gloves to a low blow
with no cup
leave you Speech less like when Arrested Development broke up
carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge
crack skulls through helmets
with the penetration of a screw nailed in
return like I was sending self addressed postage
throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge
before battles, we pour blood
and toast, death to wicked infants
found on the sorceress' doorsteps
slaughter lamb
and boar's head
every MC's cause of boredness
and mind bondage
bronchitis, lung failure
language unfam i liar
art through a flooded air brush
leave craft
sentences joined with words holding hands
it's a tight squeeze
from where your head will be landing
in exact time flight leaves

Eminem
Who's arm is this
I must have cut it off of the pharmacist
Who refused to renew my seventh presciption of darvecet
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
and never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed
I hate my life
that's why I degrade my wife
grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich
and just ate the knife
my mother's screaming 'please heal him, take him straight to Christ'
meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice
made a bomb threat with a fake device
strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice
and if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin'
I was probably just tryin to shake the lice
bugs fallin' out of my head
I'm wishin' I was dead
while I'm crawlin out of my bed
found it red and my rash is returning
I feel the sensation of burning
occurring, usually during pain for release in my urine
screamin' at my shadow 'please quit followin' me'
these pills keep screamin' 'please quit swollin' me'
the devil keeps screamin' 'please get down on one knee'
took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me

Yo check this out In life, you got your want to be's
You got your going to be's, and you got your has been's
Then you got your hustlers and hardcore

Domingo
Oh a line with fakes a time
Fresh time, with sure more times
Jimminy two time respect mine
Big click with breakfast and blacklist
War War War War
Vision, knocking you out motherfucker listen
Superstition can help you in this battle
G's and sandles who surround you in all the angles
All over your shit in shamble
Looking the little of latter you fucking runt

Hustlers Hustlers and Hardcore
Giving you more than what you asking for

Domingo
Danger hander
Banging swinging banner all single hander
Hit the left propaganda
Ill manner bad grammar stander
Got the people chasing with cameras by the manner
Hit and slap us, so pajamas
Hiding under clothes in dirty hampers
Happy brands will make them happy campers
Little laughter
Shit nappers

Eminem
I'll puke eat and freak you
Battle, I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you them both and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I lift you off your feet so fast with a round house
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
I ain't no fucking g, I'm a canibal
I ain't trying to shoot you, I'm trying to chop you into pieces and eat you
Rap you in rope and glass, strapped to a soakin matress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis

Domingo

Dr. Dre
Y'all know me, still the same O.G., but I been low key
Hated on by most these niggaz wit no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles, and no ski's
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries
Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks
to add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze  Hoe please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C's
The Snoop D O double G's
and the group that said mother Fuck Tha Police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
to bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin too good
who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggaz that said that I turned pop, or The Firm flopped 
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin no sleep
so FUCK Y'ALL, all of y'all; if y'all don't like me, BLOW ME
Y'all are gonna keep fuckin around wit me
and turn me back to the old me

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to say
but nothin comes out when they move their lips;
just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Eminem
So what do you say to somebody you hate What
Or anyone tryin to bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way YUP
Then just study a tape of N.W.A.
One day I was walkin by, wit a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
give me an awkward eye What you lookin at
And strangled him off in the parkin lot, wit his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryin to park a Dodge
when I'm drunk as fuck
Hoppin out wit two broken legs, tryin to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin barkin dogs
And when the cops came through
me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out RIGHT HERE
From here on out it's the Chronic 2
Startin today and tomorrow's the new
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death wit a Charleston Chew
Slim shady   hotter then a set of twin babies 
in a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up 
when the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin men ladies; sorry Doc but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailey Da da

Dr. Dre
If it was up to me, you muh'fuckers would stop comin up to me 
wit your hands out lookin up to me, like you want somethin free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton, Compton
I told em all   all them little gangstas 
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talkin bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all
Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad
tryin to get this damn label off
I ain't havin that; this is the millenium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin after that
So give me one more platinum plaque 
and fuck rap  You can have it back
So where's all the Madd Rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats, know that I was strapped wit gats
when you were cuddlin a Cabbage Patch

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor, to bring me back to liiiiiiife

Eminem
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin that
Doubt's startin to creep in, every day is just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick, you
gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin mic or you
gon' hug me but I'm out of options, there's nothin else I can do
Cause

Eminem
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled, cause the shit I hear
is crazy but you're either gettin lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinion's not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin yourself
Second guessin and it's almost like you're beggin for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin be my mentor
I can endure, no more; I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me, when EVERYONE was tellin you
don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin label, let's tell the TRUTH
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre I'm cryin in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin up faith, and you ain't givin up on me, GET UP DRE
I'm dyin, I need you Come back for fuck's sake
Cause

I need a doctor, doctor, to bring me back to liiiiiiife

Dr. Dre
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jumpsuit, whole room cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke
Went through friends, some of 'em I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin to the death   but where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of 'em, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair weather friends, all I need is HIM
Fuckin backstabbers, when the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin wrath of Aftermath faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
and ask where the fuck we been You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots
and the cracker's ass, little Cracker Jack
Beat makin wack ass backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin up my bags
And as I'm leavin I guarantee they'll scream Dre, don't leave us like that man
Cause

Doc, doc, you gotta give us some good news
Yeah... about that

Candice Pillay
Don't let me find out, the bitch in you
Don't let me find out, the snitch in you

Fame and fortune, it's not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders, go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the morning, overdose and kill yourself

Candice Pillay
Doctor's orders

Dr. Dre
Listen, this is my evaluation
This shit over saturated, y'all can get evacuated
Kids sippin Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the internet, stuck in place, salivatin
Ain't nobody graduatin
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it, it's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn I'm gettin aggravated, fuck I'm gettin agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fuckin schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be 13 actin 22
Niggaz be 44 actin half they ages
Somebody tell me what the fuck is goin on
These niggaz in tight shit, I'm in the fuckin Matrix
It's lookin like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin greatest
I got all these patients man, how come they ain't patient with me
They just think I want the money, why when I can take it with me
Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not
They gon' find out who you are, just admit it 'fore you get admitted

Anderson .Paak
Yeah Say, what you livin about
Fuck you gon' tell me
Do you remember where you started out though
You lookin lost now you want a pass, OH, DAMN
Fake it 'til you make it, take your little paper book
When you look in the mirror, your credibility's gone now
I'd rather be hated on for who I am
than to be loved for who I'm not, that's word to Doc

Eminem   Candice Pillay
In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed
I just shook off
Probably reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended, see how plain/plane it was, now they want me to jet
No one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til I took off
Mistook me because I look soft
But I stood tall, I just follow the doctor's orders
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided, opposin you is what I'm 'posed to do, alls
I did was, say what I'm feelin when the vocal booth calls
And had you, on pins and needles, when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fuckin goes through the walls, like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon, the drama setter
I'm goin in, already got an arm and head in
Whoever said words are just words, can't hurt me more than I give
Fuck if my image even ends up takin a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch
And whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get
So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it
And here's, to all the years I spent toein a line to overtime
As sure as a mole is blind, in my mind
I'm still underground as a groundhog and I'ma gopher/go for mine
Like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
No sign of slowin, these lines are my nines
All I needed was someone to co sign
Been a doctor's assault rifle with the sniper scope for this whole TIME
Pain in the ass and get shot in the ass with a paint GUN
Ain't no one safe from, non believers there AIN'T none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waitin on someone to say somethin
Dre make the bass pump and let the tape run
for old time's sake, I'll spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waitin for has come
But the

Doctor's orders
Doctor's orders
AHHHHHH FUCK

Phish What's the difference between me and you repeat 2X

Dr. Dre
Back when Cube, was rollin with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes
the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
Cause you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit'chu
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit'chu
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake ass niggaz I first drew with
Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then   I ain't even speakin your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

What's the difference between me and you
You talk a good one   but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin

Xzibit
Yo I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it YEAH
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick YEAH
Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions
I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do
I pop bottles and hot hollow points at each and all of you c'mon
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you What
About five back accounts, three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left
Yo that's the difference

Eminem
Aight, hold up hold up
STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE I got somethin to say
Dre; I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me
The fuck I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfuckin back riiight just know this shit

DreSlim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
EmI mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed   who's throat is it
DreWell if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is

Eminem
Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people Hi Then drop her off on the corner
at the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
and they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even THINKIN of havin them thoughts thought up~
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us  We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, I Just Don't Give a Fuck, and see who means it

FiggKidd
I thought it was evident, that figg is in his element
Whenever reality doesn't exsit, my temperament
Exposed by the evidence of festering excrement
Hard to predict my shit even if you're a weatherman
Forget it man, my mind twisted like pretzels
So I'm glad to land a hand to ruin instrumentals
Even though it's said my input is detrimental
To oz hip hop then switch off like you are meant to
I'm sent to fuck with your head, bishop with dental
Rearrange your face like Mr. Squiggle's pencil
Then escape like Christopher Skase without a trace
Pockets are laced with cash laughin' all the way to the bank
So thank you for playin' the game but do not pass go
I'mma show these lame acts that the dice will roll
Control yourself without losin' your bladder
I'm flattered that you care, but like your opinion matters, YEAH

I rap, I rap
They hate, they hate
Too late, too late
Coz nothing eva worries me
I just want you to know nothing eva worries me

Proof
If R. Kelly can take girls to never never land
And Bush can blame Osama and we never see the man
If Pee Wee can grab his dick and beat it with his hand
Then why the fuck can'tI get high and meet with Peter Pan huh
I like nice asses and boobs
I like nitrous in plastic balloons and acid and shrooms
I need sluts, I'm a pimp on a budget
Always on the low with bitches that fuck fest
Fuck yes, success is when your teenage daughter sucks best
When high on substance
I left my Visa at my rest, ask Lil' Kim to borrow her plastic
She handed me her breast
Nose and ass plus dildos
Spent 20 thou on Ebay for MJ's real nose
I'm just kiddin', coz Mike loves kiddin' around
Then serving Jesus Juice to sit 'em all down

I rap, I rap
They hate, they hate
Too late, too late
Coz nothing eva worries me
I just want you to know nothing eva worries me

FiggKidd
So nothin' ever worries me, scratchin' my balls in public
The paparazzi love it while Figg is havin' his nuts licked
You need proof, Proof Why people calling you fuckwit
Coz my dick hangin' out, when I normally tuck it
I'm stuck with, wantin' women I have no luck with
I mean sex is excellent till they find I'm a nothin'
But like I'm denyin' the fact that i'm a nobody
When honestly it's a bother to stay with a woman properly
Costin' me 4 dollars for her to spend the night with me
Chastely rob her pockets even if she was nice to me
Look for the hooker later coz she has givin' lice to me
You need a licence for that, nobody has the right to be
Givin out VD's and STD's, I mean I'm givin out disease
Through my mp3's but shit
I don't care, fuck a Nike Air
Yo Eko cut the track I'm the fuck outta here
I just want you to know nothing eva worries me

The Game
L.A.X niggas... yeahhh...

Y'all know who the fuck I am...

I'm free as a motherfuckin' bird I swear
Disappear in thin air, there go Game, nigga where
Posted on the block in them black Airs
In that all black Phantom, hug the block like a bear
Yeah, that V12 is roarin'
Flyin' through the city with the pedal to the floor then
I put them 26 inches on the curb, tell the hood I'm back
Give me a corner let me serve
Swerve, I'm still dope that's my world
All I did was switch the kitchens
Did some tracks on the birds...
Irv, I Gotti know I'ma murderer
Half these niggas beffin' with me
I never heared of them
If I was the old me I would murda them
Matter fact, if I was the old me   I would Curtis them

Refrain x2
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by my side

Eminem
I never would've dreamed in an a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me, who share the same views
And the same exact beliefs, it's like a fuckin' army, who marchin' in back of me
So many lives touch
So much anger aimed, in no particular direction, just sprays and sprays, and straight
Through your radio waves it plays and plays
Till it stays stuch in your head for days and days
Who would of thought, standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair with some peroxide
Reaching for a t shirt to wear, that I would carapult to the forefront of rap like this
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
Cause congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on...

Refrain x2
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by me side

The Game
Cos when the sun comes up from behind the sea
Niggas see my behind the B
ENT. don't stand for entertainment
Stands for zero to sixty, anybody see Game went
To the hood, parked crooked behind that chained fence
And I'm going down behind my dogs, but I ain't Vick
Tell me one album I put out that ain't sick
No I'm not the doctor, but I produce the same shit

Eminem
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady loose
Shady sits on the shelf, but Shady's cute, Shady knew, Shady's dimple's would help
Make ladies swoon baby, ohh baby, look at my sales, let's do the math
If I were black, I wouldn't of sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln high school to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at

Refrain x4
You look like you're in another world
But I can read your mind
How can you be so far away
Lying by my side

Hahahaha, ladies and gentlemen
You are now about to witness the strength, Aftermath
Straight out the motherfuckin streets of Compton
Put yo' hands together.. The Game.. BITCH
HAHAHAHA..

Yeah  Yeah motherfuckers  Compton's back on the motherfuckin map
Aftermath in that ass bitch  Game, let's go

The Game
Me and Marshall ain't start shit, they listen to our shit
and talk shit about us, but that shit is foul
when I'm tryin to feed my son and drop multi platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But it's hard when they hate us, and think Em a racist
They say shit, but fuck them, Shady one of the greatest
Like Biggie and 'Pac was, we saw the throne was empty
and decided to chase it, me him and 50 racin
This rap shit is basic, I followed that Jay shit
Think of what I wanna say, step in the booth, and one take it
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin on Dre hit
Then spit that classical L.A. N.W.A. shit
The media is bullshit, now we can't even say bitch
They accusin Michael of touchin kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of facelifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin I can taste this, swear to God I erase 'em
Put the clip in and waste 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired of this black shit, this white shit
So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this
So they callin us

We ain't, goin, nowhere, so fuck you
We ain't, goin, nowhere, so fuck you
Em This day, The Game, will never be the same
Dr Things just ain't the same for gangsters
Em The Game just isn't the same, it's changin
Em It's a new Game  You're now about to witness the power

Eminem
Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm makin
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame you tame bitch
You're mild sauce, you ain't ready to make that flame switch
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangsters in your face, which
way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Ma$e and save it
for the day that they got them affadavits wavin
in my face lookin for answers, rap senssation
Eminem battles to ward off, accusations
That he had somebody blasted, the mask of Jason
was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wastin
too much time, me no kiss ass, and if that's the case
Then we ain't goin

The Game..

The Game
Lo, get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Em just killed me on my own shit
I'm walkin through 8 Mile, startin to get homesick
I'ma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the windows tinted
If Eminem is in it, body armor under the panel
Ten these niggaz is killin it, take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix, I throw your demo out the window
For tellin me it's hot when it's not and you got
what you got from them rocks on the block you can stop
tellin Dre you got shot with a glock that don't fade me
I'm crazy, why the fuck you think I'm rhymin with Shady
I don't care if the radio don't play me; I say
what I say when I feel like I'm Phil in the Day
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G Unit sneaks
So I'm gone bitch

The Game..

Yeahhhhhhhhhh  Oh
Shut yo' ass up, Aftermath motherfucker
Haha, Game, things changin, Dr. Dre, G Unit
G G G G G Unit

Shady  That's me  > Eminem
High and Mighty Trilogy  > Mr. Eon

Funky... beats

Mr. Eon
Packin this third eye, pursue a Cyclops
They trade in they high tops for nice sized white rocks
Excuse me Words in my right, that pass my left ear
Your style is ass out like the Bulls are next year you're GONE
Fear this veneer, you get stung like virgins
Who that cat splurgin instead of rehearsin
Tough guys, degentrify your high rise
Lookin more like Ronald than them fuckin Fry Guys
Go on uptown fuckin senoritas
In Taco Bell screamin, Viva gorditas 
Bring all your dogs   I give em rabies
They never had a chance like my two aborted babies WAAAH
Got Pope John Paul the 2nd, prayin to Satan
Have your vegan girlfriend cookin up bacon
on barbituates with that shit that you hit
Smoke my spliffs withcha, cause spinal bifida

Eminem
My nine is liftin ya, six feet when I spray rounds
Hit you with 12 shots in mid air and four more on the way down
as eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher Don't get carried away now
No pun intended, just hop out of your whip
and leave it un attended before I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute
Cause I can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it
Snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it
Corner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged
Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged
like cavewomen, while I'm gravediggin with Marilyn Man'

If you got a bowl of hash better cash it
You got a satchel, flash it, I'ma take your last hit
And if you spittin wack shit on the microphone
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'ma detach it
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
You got a satchel, flash it, I'ma take your last hit
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in the hatchback and latched it

Mr. Eon
Yo yo, Eon's wack now, how you think that
Couldn't get on my record if you were shrink rap can I get a rhyme
Desecrate a crate with these rhymes I be totin
Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem
I got stupid mucus from these loose lips
My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak
to the point that you stand up on your feet, best retreat
Let's go back in time and steal my whole steez
The Quickening, did a bris at the christening
I'm exercisin, doing liftings and twistings
Instinct's the nicest, I keep tellin you
What the fuck this guy on the corner been sellin you 

Eminem
Here   buy this I'm e mailin you, at the wrong website
and mispellin you, prank you and put the fear of hell in you
Escaped Bellevue, stuffed the nurse in a purse
Slim Shady, a perverted version of birth
Drivin off, leaving a murdered virgin at church
The first person who searchin the earth for the motherfucker 
that pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first
Kill his ass Get thrown curves, and hit with your own words
Leave me alone bitch  I get on my own nerves
And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up
I'm takin off both shoes and stickin each middle toe up
Fuck y'all

Eminem
Any disease out there I'm willin to catch it...
Slim Shady...
All praises to The High & Mighty

Slim Shady, naughty rotten rhymer
Mr. Eon,  illest rhyme dropper
Slim Shady, naughty rotten rhymer

Teller Hi
Eminem How you doin'
Teller How can I help you
Eminem Yeah, I need to make a withdrawal...
Teller What Oh my God, don't kill me
Eminem I'm not gonna kill you, bitch. Quit fucking around
Teller Don't kill me, I have two kids at home
Eminem I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you
Teller Don't kill me

I gotta keep this engine running I'll be back
Pedal to the metal, Swifty better hurry up
'Cause I ain't going back to jail
I don't wanna see my face up in Newsweek
I'm sitting like a duck, like Tulley up in Blue Streak
What the fuck is taking so long
Hurry up, motherfucker, I'ma hit this gas and be GONE
But I can't leave my homey Hold up They all know me
I'm the Jeff Gord on of this bitch, the cops can blow me
Fuck, who is that Shit, I'm getting nervous
Staring out this dirty windshield for any persons
Damn, it's this bum, cleaning with a squeegee
Here's a dollar, motherfucker, now scram before they see me
I hope they didn't ring the alarm Shit
Swifty's gonna have to bomb, and then it fucks up the job
But I don't care, as long as we flee this place
'Cause the last thing I need is a fucking police chase, shit
Cool, here he comes, I hope he's got the stash
Yo nigga, pull off We heading to the bank for some mo' cash
Yo, there better be enough for me to get that maid back
Hey yo, don't worry 'bout that, dog, the cash is in our laps

Put the money in the back, bitch, this is a stickup
Anybody who moves is getting picked up, off the ground
This is the sound, this is how its going down
If I'm going down, then you're going down down
Now this is the plot: we pull this off, then we split the pot
We get caught, I'm peeling off, the deal is off
But if we can pull this caper, then we can get this paper
Then I'm going, off to Tijuana
Come on, I'm ready if you are

while I sit in the car chiefing
In the mood to be thieving this season
Hey yo, Hush, I'ma snatch what they 
Pull over and I'ma rob this bitch for a purpose
You can either read it or see it
What you mean, Read it or see it
It'll work, know what's worse
It's better than having to beat a bitch up out of her purse
I been pacing this bank, patiently waiting
For the day they get up in this motherfucker
So don't drive away I'll be right here
Hey 'sup Nigga, pop the trunk so I can grab the AK
And then I'm headed to the safe
I'm at the counter in the teller's face
Yo, if anybody move, I'ma make spaghetti out of your wife Don't shoot
I hopped a gate, shot a citizen
After he gave me the combination to open it
And there was nothing but Benjamins
Filled it back and jetted up, headed to the door
Hush is in the front, revving up Motherfucker, come on
I jumped over the security, while he on the floor
Trying to pull my feet, I shot him before he could draw
Hit the street and we swerve
No less than a hundred thousand in our back seat
Now I'm peeling off the curb

I got some chips up my sleeve
I walked in a 7 11 and grabbed Aviv
And put the heat to his cheek
Don't even think about moving
Just gimme the loot and I'll be cruising
Along with my day and it won't be a shooting
Mister, please don't hurt me Here, have a Slurpee
Oh my God, Aviv, shut the fuck up, your voice irks me
All of this for three hundred seventy six dollars and eight cents
This robbery does not make sense
Come on out bitch scream Yeah, you, behind the chip rack
Your little stank ass is on the verge of getting pimp slapped
Gimme your paper, your jewels, and all of your valuables
Serious about that scrilla, Kuniva an animal
Rushing out the front door, zigzagging and dodging traffic
If it gets drastic, my automatic will start a blasting
That's how we do it where I'm from, me, Swift, and Hush
We ducking off, contemplating which lick to rush

Bizarre: Boys and girls... this is a broadcast brought to you by...
some real ghetto Detroit shit...

I tried to come up with a speech that heat seeks
In a mans last stand with a heart that beats week
Who each week turns on the tube to sneak peek
And see the same dude on a screen in repeats so
Consider every word that I spit
Every song on my albums a movie and this is the pilot
You're forced to eat rhymes and this a mere chapter of skills
And here after you'll feel the FEAR FACTOR
A lone diver in flows and more liver in shows
With eye of the tiger like SURVIVOR
You seen it all before I just inherit the title emcee
Now it's me your new AMERICAN IDOL
Without all of the bull or me in a seat rhyming
I'll fuck Paula Abdul and beat the shit out of Simon
I'm not your BIG BROTHER I'm JOE MILLIONAIRE
With your bitch throwing hundred dollar bills in the air

Back to life hey yo I gotta take it
Back to reality yeah
Back to the here and now uh
Back to life I gotta bring it
Back to reality so I gotta take it
Back to the here and now uh

See I gotta change the channel in rap take it back as a hole
One of these rappers try to act as THE MOLE
Just an AVERAGE JOE or just a JACKASS
Probably a BACHELOR with QUEER EYE for straight ass
I'm no APPRENTICE I landed a DREAM JOB
In a scene where each mob on the streets with teams rob
We don't live A SIMPLE LIFE we live by ROAD RULES
TIL DEATH DO US PART and the tools are old school
Fuck ELIMIDATE I should start elimi fake emcee
Who's career is just 1 big mistake cuz
This is the REAL WORLD where you watch from cheap seats
WEAKEST LINK's get killed over beats and defeats
2 of the best died they don't find no murder weapon
No suspects no TAXI CAB CONFESSION
No search star killers the faces glazed over
This entire case needs an EXTREME MAKEOVER what

Bizarre: Don't touch that dial... we'll be right back after these messages...
you dirty filthy ass nasty son of a bitch...

I gotta bring it

I'm hot I don't stop when I'm taking a stand
And keep my pockets Puffy like I'm MAKING THE BAND
Won't be no TRADING SPACES or even A CHANGE OF HEART
I don't use SCARE TACTICS I'll tear you apart
This is reality to make it though BOOTCAMP
WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE with a pocket of food stamps
YOU GOTTA SEE THIS for THIRTY SECONDS OF FAME
AMERICA'S MOST WANTED try and step in this game
They water down the show with these hooks that just rival
Ozzy OSBOURNE'S speech when he needs a sub title
I'm not in it for fame or even the props
If I wasn't ripping mics you could find me on COPS
Being chased by hands of fans for autographs
And police who say I left them a trail of bloodbath
For killing instrumentals from snares & kicks now
To guitars & licks arrested and thrown in THE BIG HOUSE

Bizarre: This has been a public service announcement... from your man Hush...
and I'm Bizarre from D 12... what the fuck...
we about to shoot the club up... I'm gone... Rock City...
Hush... Bizarre... Rap Guys
Hahahaha... 2 rap guys... I'm out...

Wild men is flappin the whole town though

More lies than truth definatly more rumors than reality
Only way you beatin a body is a technicality
Other than that catch em and clinton on a gallery
The determination and dedication of disipline
Listenin and catchin the jewels you was missin
And they still doin coward shit
You know the haters gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Somethin in the air but the older they get
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick
We don't play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say I'm exquisite
Anytime you can pay us a visit

Stick up kids every block who walks with that free op 
Portunity, as soon as you leave out that jewelry shop
And you won't even notice your mind will be so preo 
Ccupied on that new watch you just copped
You won't even see that ride pull up along side you
You'll be shot fore you even realize you were spied over three blocks
D Block the place where gees get knocked, locked up
Get out come home for a week and get re knocked
You don't even see cops, hiphop police don't even stop
On D Block, where everybody wants to be Pac
And you can get popped over the new G Unit reboks

Motherfuckers  
say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels bling bling
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothin, I made somethin doin
what I do through and through and
I give you the news   with a twist it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade; you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters, and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
Mommy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No he's not around   now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin 'round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it
I help them see they way through it   not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt

Eminem
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
Cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin his music to steer it, sharin his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference   they're sayin you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America
as a motherfuckin drug addict   like you didn't experiment
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrased
And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin do gooders   too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
Ha ha And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss My Ass it's just the

Jay Z
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollerin Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin braver
Doo rag wrappin my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me   I'm awkward, I box leftier often
My pops left me an orphan, my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown; 'specially on nights
I brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor   thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up
Raisin my fingers to critics; raisin my head to the sky
Big I did it   multi before I die nigga
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

Eminem
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and Satan a scatter brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter   a gateway to escape
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin Dixie
while I'm wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
in holy water   no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin spiteful, DELIGHTFUL eyeful
The new Ice Cube   motherfuckers HATE to like you
What did I do huh I'm just a kid from the gutter
makin this butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a muh'fuckin

A shimmy shimmy go go motha fuckin pop dance
It's the K K Kid Rock with the K K Kid Rock shit
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips
I get all the money pussy falls like rain
Been gettin' laid and paid that's why I never complain
And if I ain't in it for the money I'm in it for the P
It's 1998 so and you still can't fuck with me
You don't be fuckin' with the blue eye
Fuckin' with my 2 5 up your fuckin' ass like my shoe size
I got a new vibe, kinda like Voodoo
You do what we say and we'll do what we wanna do
We're fuckin' up your city and we're fuckin' up your progam
Fuckin' all your bitches we can fuckin' give a goddamn
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
We won't quit until we're banned from existence
Persistance pays if that holds true
Then I'm gonna buy this fuckin' planet before the time I'm through
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no takings
So let me get what I got comin' and the rest I'm takin'
I'm shakin' like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
You act like a motherfucker's brand new at this shit
But I've been true to this shit given' my heart and soul
Been shinin' like a diamond, gettin' passed as coal
Yeah

With my pants half hangin' off my ass and shit
Bowl filled hash pockets stuffed with cash
I be the mushroom trippin' sippin' shots of Jack
'Cause the kids don't listen gettin' lots of flack
I be the do wa diddy up and down you block and
The 10 karat Kid with my triggers cockin'
The K the I the D R O C K motherfucker and you still don't know me
So blow me bitch I don't rock for cancer
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit
I ride like Setta in the Indy 5
And get live with that which get's me high
Strive for perfection this much is true
We do what we say you say what we do
Kid Rock I couldn't be no Bozo
And I get too much nina, ever be no homo
Rock from Soho to Arizona
I'm an easy rider dreamin' of Wynonna
I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
Put faith in lust and in God I trust
I'm not Peter Pan I don't fuck with fairies
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries
And Harry Carey couldn't call my game
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast
Yeah right in your mother fuckin' ass bitch
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit swift we're on the same script
Nothing new since 76 Kid Rock
Yo Slim Shady come break these mother fuckers off

Eminem
Yo tell the world to hold their breath they're breathing in the wrong air
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Two white boys who spike punch and light joints
Hang around drugs loud music and like noise
Slim Shady and Brown Trucker another bunch of mother fuckers
Who hate the world just as much as each other
And I ain't leaving this party tonight
'Til I see some naked bitches dancin' around drunk touchin' each other
Rum and Pepsi got your whole perception of me sketchy
'Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
'Cause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do 'shrooms you all better give me two rooms
'Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
So when you see me on your block you better lock your cars
'Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
This is for children who break rules
People that straight fool
And ever single teenager that hates school

Fuck Off

I live in a world, that's different than your world
Your world still believes in things like free speech and democracy
Those things don't exist in my world anymore
Welcome to my world
Welcome to Planet X motherfucker

It used to be parks
It used to be jungle gyms
Now they just stories passed down orally
from my great grandmother an' 'em
It used to be public pools
Kids loved to swim 'til the summer's end
Now it's enough poison in the water to slaughter your son and your daughter
You could blame the government
Let me tell you how it all started
The middle class was evaporated
Then the filthy rich couldn't stand the stench of the dirt poor
Of course who had the world oversaturated
So a new world order was activated
No more black, no more white, no more brown, no more yellow, no more red
Just high born citizens, and low born citizens
And all that race shit was eradicated
You're either rich or you're poor now
Digital identity chip implanted in everybody born now
Bein poor is like fightin a war now
No energy to fight the real enemy because you're worn out
Livin life on a tight rope
But the trickery is the tight rope, it's slippery as a ice slope
Every second somebody is fallin off
So we figure we embrace the misery, nigga we never liked hope
Cause hope was the buzzword
that they use to brainwash us, fuck that, we unlearn
Now the rich people concerned
cause they know our return is confirmed by holdin a gun firm
What's that in the distance
You fucked the slums raw 'til they gave birth to a resistance
You scared lookin out your window
You see your own fuckin children crawlin over your fences

One by one, they all come, slow to meet their fates
Two by two I bury them, in their shallow graves
Three by three they've come at me, their guns and swords were drawn
Now four by four before the Lord, they'll choose a witchy spawn
Cause we're coming for you coming for you, coming for you
La la la la la, we're coming for you
La la la la la, we're coming for you

KXNG Crooked
Yo, what you gon' do now
It's too late for talkin, I'm in your face with the tool out
Foot wearin the other shoe now
The chickens came home to roost now, who got the juice now
Aiyyo, what you gon' do now
You wanna truce now, I'm in your face with the tool out
Foot wearin the other shoe now
The chickens came home to roost now, who got the juice now
Oil addiction, water polution
Who got the juice now
Soil contamination, and overconsumption
Tell me who got the juice now
Wiped out two thirds of the planet's fresh water
Who got the juice now
And crop reserves, creating a vast wasteland
Who got the juice On a global scale

I'm all alone in my basement with a gun. I'm so high
I'm all alone in my basement with a gun. Time to die

All the stories I'm livin. Paintin portraits of me being hanged
and tortured by midgets. Am I worth the minion
Life of a skitzo
that's playin a normal person. Hides it so good though
He's prayin with you at church and he's takin your kids to football
games, your favorite neighbor
Who really just wants to cook your brains, and taste 'em later
I'm that guy at that McDonald's that be serving your food
You heard the news. Local worker done murdered to morning crew
God told me to do it. I'm deaths angel
Calm only when doing that Mary Jane girl
The nicest person that you never want to meet
Has to restrain himself from killing everyone he sees
Blastin your brain with shells, hittin seven of your peeps
A bastard that made hell, I'm who the devil wants to be
Black magic, I'm sayin spells hoping the dead will come to me
I'm all alone in my basement with a gun

I'm all alone in my basement with a gun. Pull the trigger, pull the trigger I'm so high
I'm all alone in my basement with a gun. Pull the trigger, pull the trigger Time to die
I'm all alone in my basement with a gun. Pull the trigger, pull the trigger I'm so high
I'm all alone in my basement with a gun. Pull the trigger, pull the trigger Time to die

Ongoing investigations
I've been compared to Jason
Though he's for choppin up fourteens by the lake
For God sakes
their only fourteen
Eyes open like they wide awake been dead for four weeks
Smokin weed takin threonine
Death is certain. Help me please, thinkin morbid things
Self murder was corsin through my veins
Horrible, hurts the brain
Listen to Jimi Hendrix. Worshippin Kurt Cobain
The ghetto Edgar Allan Poe
Sever your head with a staff to the throat
You're better off dead. Roll his ashes to smoke
A sorry orphan kid that lived in foster homes
Starved and torn man. Wish he had some parents of his own
Now he walks the streets. Everyday thirsty for blood
He been stalkin me, everyday running for us
Give me some more lithium, I have the urge to bury shit
I need some help for this, I got to stop killing my therapist

I'm all alone in my basement with a gun. Pull the trigger, pull the trigger I'm so high
I'm all alone in my basement with a gun. Pull the trigger, pull the trigger Time to die
I'm all alone in my basement with a gun. Pull the trigger, pull the trigger I'm so high
I'm all alone in my basement with a gun. Pull the trigger, pull the trigger Time to die

I'm supposed to be playing professional hockey
Short and stocky. With a hook like Rocky
I'm deadly than full blown AIDs
Matta fact, I got full blown AIDs from fuckin John Bennet
My little girl got a heat exhaustion
I thought that she would be alive after two weeks in Boston
Sexy women... I fucking hate
Tie me up with a rope and feed me corn flakes
My grandmother... She just turned 75
For a gift I'm giving her a black eye
Sex offender who calls himself Ronald
Jacking my dick, watching the excersise channel
My mother... she's a known slut
My job is ear her pussy and make sure the grass is cut Like this mommy
On Van Dyke and Harper eatin a big baby
It's not a hamburger... It's a fucking old lady

I'm all alone in my basement with a gun. Pull the trigger, pull the trigger I'm so high
I'm all alone in my basement with a gun. Pull the trigger, pull the trigger Time to die

hoes strip, where pimps and hoes do strolls
It's the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show
Where hustlas collect rocks and straight rolls

Welcome home motherfuckers your back again
into the den of inequity the life of sin
Where after the after party and the hotel lobbies
probably find me drunk off Bacardi in a swank hotel
an aspiring actress
Trying to push her back through a thousand dollar mattress
In Chicago a couple of bottles, couple of models, stolen Diablos
Fast and furious going full throttle
post club function, pills get swallowed
Ladies get loose and so do bra staps
power, money, and sex drive good raps
Freaks emerge in a twilight with party pack
of hydros alchohol blurred eye sight
From dusk til dawn is when vampires roam
pro athletes trick and don't go home

Riding with my nigga Big Boi you don't sleep
even partied with Diddy up in NYC
Got drunk, rubbed titties of Dominican freaks
every night bachelor party in the boom boom room
On trees get burned or liquor consumed
you ain't really seen a color till you seen it on shrooms
Lipstick on the pale of my Pelle Pele
spot hotter than fish scales cooked in coked ale
Vampire party and we gets it down
in the undergrounds underground
Underground in club commer's basement
ladies and low lifes do get wasted
So high you can't hear the music but you feel it when the bass hits
the atmosphere like the first year
Freak bass hit everybodys heart goes fast
rolling Mitsubishi's shakin' that ass

Got twenties on the Escort, bitch park my shit
It's Bizzare from D12 in this bitch yeah

I'm the club with Suge Knight, Ike, and Killer Mike how does it feel
Fat dick for all my enemies

My girlfriends a fucking fool
when she turned her back
I'm making out with her mother like I'm in high school shhh
And I don't sale crack to my African brothers
I sell it to they mothers and they ex lovers that's true
So go ahead bitch pop the X
so I can work your neck in the back of my Vett ahh
Red bones, I hate 'em no question
I like fat bitches with bladder infections ughh
Bizzare get down from strokers to Magic City
It's the creep show, show your nasty titties

Lil Wayne
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try but I'm cursed so never mind
And it's worse but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher, the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryin to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But, soon for a nigga it be on muh'fucker
Cause, all this bullshit done made me strong muh'fucker
So I

Pick the world up and I'ma DROP it on yo' fuckin head, yeah
Bitch I'ma pick the world up and I'ma DROP it on yo' fuckin head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker
I'm gone.. motherfucker I'm gone

Lil Wayne
Uhh, I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven sent, and you're hell proof
I I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside
So I could

Eminem
I'm gone... I'm gone, I'm gone
It hurts but I never show, this pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream fuck 'em all
Man it feels like these walls are closin in, this roof is cavin in
Up it's time to raise it then, your days are numbered like pagers and
My book of rhymes got 'em cookin boy, this crooked mind of mines 
got 'em all shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin clock I took the time
And I, came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up, fuck this fame that ain't what
I came to claim but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'ma make these fuckin haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words so your fuckin heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently bitch it's beddy bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible, hoe you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin head'll spin dawg
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives
I'll fuckin

Eminem
I'm gone... I'm gone, I'm gone

You don't want none of it, none of it
You know we come wit it, come wit it
Go get your guns and clips, guns and clips
Give them their punishment, punishment
Kill who we wanna kill, bust who we wanna bust
Steal what we wanna steal, fuck who we wanna fuck

Eh yo, I need a mic, I kick rhymes at the speed of light
I'm a different person everyday, I wonder who I be tonight
I got split personalities for niggas that try to challenge me
I make 'em walk through galleries and get on they nerves like allergies
I make 'em burn calories, I make 'em earn salaries
Livio, I'm the one, I make rappers call me Your Majesty
I'm blindin' ya eyesight, I feel like I been alive twice
The SOURCE can't even deny this deserves more than five mics
My style is hard, if ya bite me, you'll be chippin' ya tooth
As soon as I get in the booth, niggas witness the truth
I hit ya hard and tell Bizarre to get me the Proof
You niggas might be dyin' to win, but ya livin' to lose
I'm givin' you clues, you already forgettin' the news
I came to make ya feet stank and take a shit in ya shoes
Now, I got two niggas wit me, but you'll hear what I said first
I'll make ya head burst and keep it rollin' like Fred Durst
I go berserk 'cause of the way my brain networks
No matter where ya at, you do it here, do it there
Ain't nothin' jockin' you niggas but a little bit of pubic hair, mothafucka

chorus
Niggas can't fuck wit me
And you niggas is stuck wit me
D 12 is up wit me
And you niggas can't fuck wit me

Kill who we wanna kill, bust who we wanna bust
Steal what we wanna steal, fuck who we wanna fuck

Marchin' 90 ghosts, gold roast, plus plaque
You laid on ya back, Bizarre overreacts
Bitches and ballers, I'm stickin'
Give you a 2 piece like Kentucky Fried Chicken
From Seattle to Detroit, I gets gully
I beat a bitch's ass who swear to God I'm Huggy
You wanna fight Let's throw up
Ask Three 6 Mafia about the clubs we done tore up
Bizarre come through wit a street cleaner
You see so much Blood, you'd swear you was in Pasadena
Battle I'll run through ya crew
Mad 'cause you ain't out like Playstation 2
Detroit, what You dealin' wit a fuckin' nut
Fuck ya grandmother in the butt, call her a dirty slut
You wanna battle Skidaddle
'Cause you ain't needed like Patrick Ewing in Seattle

chorus: 2X
I spit flames, Dirty Harry's the nickname
Kidnap sluts and feed 'em crack like Rick James
Neighborhood Spiderman, hype off Vicaden
And generic vitamins snypin' through a rifle lens
At ya church at who recitin' them triflin' Bible kins
Then gank the Billy Blanks for his rank and tae bo gyms
Come hard when I write, wit slugs slide viagara
Make you fall like Niagra, marvelous is haggler
The bad batter that smash matter
Make your chin a glass shatter, ya moms, I'll blast at her
I'm a glock holder born in October
A pot smoker that was high when I shot Oprah
My cradle was knocked over, I'm not sober
Bumpin' Biggie Smalls, run by wit two of Tupac's posters
Proof and Livio love to spit a flow
Make ya Faces of Death out ya next video

Yo, pass the mic and watch me come off fast as light
They love to hear what I say when they got questions, they ask me twice
I answer once, I don't spit rhymes to rhyme to
I spit shit so you could tell when you bein' lied to
I don't wanna be lied to, so I got nothin' to ask a liar
Why even bother wit a man that make 'em suck like pacifiers
So pass the fire, fa sho, I drop the guillotine, fa sho, I got the killa green
That shit that make me look like I'm from the Phillipines
I'm talkin' chinky eyed, I'll make a man scream so loud everyone think he died
I'll cut off four of his fingers and let his pinky slide
And take him deep down under, I mean it, brotha
I'll jam you up like peanut butter
And shine ya ass up till I make ya fart replenish
I'll make ya heart diminish
I take you start to finish, I plan on gettin' high as a cloud
As soon as I break apart the spinach, yooo...
You don't want beef wit me, my beef is heavy enough to break ya dish
When you see me, make a wish 'cause I'm a leave you wet as a fish
I ain't the type to tell 'em twice, Livio, let 'em learn
They treatin' rap like doorknobs, and lettin' everyone get a turn
Let the air hit emcees, be a part of hip hop
Man, you niggas couldn't rap if you worked at a giftshop
Fuck you, fuck you, uh... mothafucka

chorus: 6X

Woo Yeah Remix 50 Cent: Ha Ha
Lloyd Banks Lloyd Banks: Uh Huh Ha Ha

It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down give him a crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king but he don't do a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He don't want the room and he don't want the loot he's in it for the sport
Runnin circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin for it
And you can love and you can hate it
but you can't ignore it, you can't be that ignorant
But you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And If I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doin a hundred twenty in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's straight outta a neighborhood where niggaz hate
To see you blow and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
There stomachs ache while he's loungin in the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand where the nigga stay, houses with a bigger gate
Houndin him's a big mistake, he won't surrender he'll rather give up a rib to break
Cause he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin hand
Till he was sittin on green like a Celtics fan
Created a buzz to where you gotta mention his name
When you discussin the illest playa that's in the game
And he's ridin with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and 'em
G Unit Records ain't a motherfucker stoppin them

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doin a hundred twenty in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's no magician man the kid does something out of nothin
So that nigga's from his hood act like he owes him somethin
They talk crazy till they send niggaz to where to buck him
Ask him if it's a problem and he'll say nah it's nothin
He was gonna help 'em out but since they funny fuck 'em
He don't care how they feel they can hate him or love him
He held his own on his own the kid is really thuggin
He's rich now he ain't change so niggaz think he buggin
He bulletproof everything cause niggaz try and buck him
Keeps two pistols I'll show you where he tuck 'em
Niggaz say they 'gon get at him but they can't touch him
Try to catch you slippin then creepin he start bussin

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doin a hundred twenty in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

I can give you niggaz somethin you can talk about
I can turn your smile upside down
You ain't no G you a fuckin clown
I can take your girl and tu turn her out
Don't hold it in let it all out
I can give you fuckers somethin to be mad about
Invite her in send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth

Yeah, you got me
I'm up now, it's your loss
It sucks to be you

Eminem
History is like a point of no delay
Keeps repeatin itself, what else can I say
You wonderin why I act this way
I never should've gave you the time of day
Guess you know what time it is now, ay
There must've been a gust of wind
Cause you change your mind every time it blows and you just changed it a muh'fuckin gain
You just said you just wanted some dick, 'fore I stuck it in
I wouldn't have been such a prick to you, fuckin men
You say you don't trust 'em
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushin Some shit is goin down
You must've just not have been truthful from the start
See for me it'd be nothin to say you never had my heart but I'd be lyin
Fuckin see why they call this bullshit a relationship, ships sink
And you know it's love as soon as you fall in it cause shit stinks
And it feels like every time I fuckin do, I get jinxed
Cupid must've put a curse on me, six weeks
have went by, and we only spoke twice
I'm sittin in your driveway callin you from the car, suffice
I think it's safe to say you're not at home
I'm callin your cell phone you answer but I can tell though, that you're not alone
How was I to know
It should've been time to go a long time ago; I kept holdin on
It's comical when I think back now, why I couldn't get the hint
You feel the draft you were thrown, I wasn't catchin your drift
But there's a cold breeze blowin over me, I'm over you
Success is the best revenge to pay you back, and that payment is overdue
I overcame odds to get even
The sober me is shittin all over the un sober you
And I hope they play this at every club that you're goin to
I'm hauntin you bitch, everywhere you turn I'm followin you
Cause I loved you with every ounce of me, you know it's true
It's killin you now, yeah I hope the hoe dies slow in you
It's cause of you now I don't trust 'em at all, fuck 'em
Middle finger up, I'ma just keep grabbin my balls, cup 'em
I never fall again, I trip on stairs, I fall up 'em
So buttercup don't try to come back knockin on my door all dolled up
Cause I'm movin on, don't worry about me
Cause I'ma be just fine without you, you'll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I'd much rather be
Cause God damnit I'm glad that I'm me

I said if you could be where I'm at bye bye
You'd wanna be you too I'm livin without you
If you felt the way I feel I bet you'd be in as good a mood as I am
But you don't cause you just feel like you

Lloyd Banks
Uhh, I've had it for the last time, your actions got me hot as my last rhyme
Your options are leave or get put out, granted your ass fine
But fine just ain't gon' cut it, drama's what you're in love with
You and your bitches you run with, lately I'm feelin smothered
You snooped around for dirt to be uncovered
Conceited with Cover Girl motives, I gotta rise above it
You think them models lovin me, I'm thinkin 'bout who doesn't
Doesn't really matter what you say, sickness in my stomach
Told you I was gon' be splittin, you don't think I mean it
Meant through with everything that I got, fuck you, ain't no secret
No apologies you keep it, now that I'm doin my thing and you peep it
The badder times all outweigh the recent
Your energy, who needs it Every rumor you hear you go believe it
Point out the times you seen it, you stabbed me should've linked it
Revenge is mine, I need it, need a way out
It's my fuckin life, let her find a way to stay out
Bet you thought I'd break, it ain't that easy
Bet you thought I'd need you a million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you, ain't no freebies, get your coat and go
The female Pinocchio, money hungry hopeless hoe
You fuckin with my focus so, go back to that trunk and play the role befo'
Love is like a cancer when you don't let go go
I'ma blow for sho', unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I don't need you sinkin us, hope you float
Lyin through my teeth, I hope you don't drown, drown
Now the sound of that be dope, bottles pop hourly smoke
Hit me the pride that we broke, let them girls crowd on me go
If they got somethin to show, let them show me
I don't love 'em, never lonely, never even left a scar
You fell hard, I'm laughin, ha ha ha ha ha
Tire smoke, fancy car, nothin is what we are
Cause I'm movin on, don't worry about me
Cause I'ma be aight without you, you'll see

There ain't no one on this Earth right now I'd much rather be

Son, you know why you the greatest alive
Why, Dad
Because you came out of my balls, nigga

Fuck rap

I'm foamin at the mouth, ain't nobody takin me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration
But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school He's cool, he's not rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin lyricism when I'm spillin it
I'm feelin myself, yeah yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit
Well, it don't really matter cause I'm killin this shit
Yeah I'm killin this shit

No, we ain't fuckin with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place but if you ain't comin with the illest of raps
Callin yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that

You gon' get smacked, you gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
Bobby Boy

Logic

Chika chika chika chika chika chika chika chika chika Slim Shady

Eminem
Jigga jigga jigga jigga jigga like JAY Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
are getting washed, ligga ligga ligga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy, unloadin
Leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and, slumps over
Like A Rod in a month lull but he just homered
... Hold up, I said
Rover because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin dog sounds cause I gotta keep breakin these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go roof like the Dobermann said
I still think the roof would go over your head haha
Beast mode   motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
with so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out rhymed, how could I be dethroned
I stay on my toes like the repo
A behemoth in sheep clothes from the East Coast
to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin thing though cause MC's know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts, your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self loathe
I don't wanna fuckin listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal, I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin to get the cannabis
I'm lookin for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin
Batterin everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin the bandanna back, and the fuckin headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin of bringin the fuckin fingerless gloves back
And not givin a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin millionaire
with a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin air duct
I'm about to bare knuckle it   nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket, abraca fuckin dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted
I'm attackin it, what Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

Look what I'm plannin, plannin, I'm plannin to
Do all this while ya panickin
And you're lookin and starin at mannequins
And I'm goin to, Fanagans tryin to get up a plan against
All of the blana kazana ka fam bam bannigans
While of all the bana kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab 
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin the stamina
You're lackin the stamina while you're divorcin Harrison Ford
and I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin
You usin way too many napkins, papkins
Lapkins and chapki 
You usin ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin
Flappin around like a bapkin
Flamminababbitapannitajampkin
Dammit, a can of pada 

uhh, hell yea man, hm, oh fuck yeah
when I'm not at home, beating my shit to death
I'm listening to the Madd Rapper's album
This is Ken Kaniff, and I'm still mad as hell...fuck you

Eminem
I'm crazy with this razor with this razor I'm crazy
With this crazor I'm razy, razor crazed I'm crazy
Ok I'm Re Loaded Go Bring Jay Z
Tell them him I'ma ghostwrite for him Over Dre's Beats
Ran in the ladies room naked in a blanket
At the banquet and started to spank it  AHHH
Came in the bank with a tank, fired a blank
At the clerk and handcuffed her ankles to the safe and thanked her
But I didn't take nothing Thanks
Every bullet came from the same gun
Just from different angles, cause I was pickin' strange places to aim from
Mad Rapper: Man, I bet you 50 bucks you won't jump out the window Shady
Ahhhh  Pay me

Madd Rapper
Psych, no way fucked up in the head
Shot my girl and my sister cause I caught them in bed  Wait, wait, wait
I'm a crazy mothafucka might shoot me a fed
Or I just might start a fist fight instead
See as far as the dough go
I go loco, see me pumpin gas at your local Sunoco
Stuck off the hydro mixed with cocoa
Jump turnstyles, then run from po po

Life stinks, we dont give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is  CRAZY

Madd Rapper
Yo yo, i wish I'd been aborted
My pockets got a shortage
Everything I wanna floss I can't afford it
I'm tryin to sell a O', my pops tryin' to snort it
My daughter's babysitter is about to be deported
I'm mad cause I still stand in line for clubs
Mad cause my rottweiler still shits on the rugs God Dammit Spike
Feeling kinda crazy now, I just might flip out
Slim Shady gave me shrooms and I might trip out, like...
Eh....  Oh...  Dude...  That shit's crazy man...  oohhhh..... This is 
incredible... ohhh....
Fuck that Slim keep that for yourself
You a crazy white dude and u need some help, word

Eminem
I got a beautiful wife, kids and a gorgeous home
What would make jump in the tub with a cordless phone
I'm straight viscious I hit you with plates and dishes
Leave you eight stitches, what I'm gay cause I hate bitches
Slut dont be nice to me, I've had it with girls
And i'll still be mad at the world, even if it apoligized to me Sorry
You're hearing the last thoughts of a man about to blow his fuckin' brains out
Fall back with a blood stained blouse on top of his spouse
Spread out on a blood stained couch 
In front of his kids that he just killed in the same house
I'm sicker than Boy George picturin' Michael Jackson 
Shady said it, Shady meant it, I stay demented
I'll throw a stroller at u, with a baby in it
Go ahead pull the plug, think I won't smack you
I just dropped a fuckin' pill mom, dont vacuum

Ooooh We have returned
Yeah, show you how to flow again show you how to flow again
It's the rap rule again hehehehe Yo, yo..

Holla for a dollar, yea, and y'all ain't gotta go home
But y'all gotta get the fuck outta here
Who stay Lo like Jennifer, won't see me a lot
But when you see Vivica, tell her she a Fox

Streetlife Method Man
We rollin', big truck, sittin' on chrome twistin' a bone
Talkin' to a bird on the bat phone
Zonin', out the area, roamin'
The closest you could come to my style, maybe, is clonin'
The omen I'm warnin' you now Niggaz is holdin'
Run up, watch me put one up in your colon
Chizzle town, thugs in the club, like chicks posin'
Lambchop niggaz is sheep in wolf clothing

Streetlife Method Man
Beware, danger, shoot off your flares
Warn all your dogs tell 'em we here
The Stat' we don't bust our guns in the air
Never that, y'all don't come out til the coast is clear
Who you suppose to fear Street, I fears no one
You all thumbs, I probably murder you with your gun
When I start lettin' off niggaz is jettin' off
You straight chicken broth, we holes in your terrycloth

Method Man
Double O, 3, long time no see
Who mind parts seas, and cause blind to see
Some think this industry is just all rhyme and G
Then he make it to the door, and he can't find the key
Don't know what it be, to make y'all follow my lead
Or make this pretty thing on her knees swallow my seed
If rap wasn't rap no more, what would it be
I don't know, I'd be zonin' sometime, must be the weed... that's that shit

We just some dogs, we just some dogs

Method Man
By any means necessary, it's on
Bitch, your fucking with a dog, all I wanna do is bury some bones
Take a piss on a tree and I'm gone, girlfriend don't get it wrong
I hate to be the one to shit on your lawn, but I ain't got my dog license
I ain't nothing nice, and I ain't never met a piece of pussy I ain't liking
Sugar and spicing, kicked up with ice and, you can do anything with these hoes
Except housewife them, like snoop said it ain't nothing but a G thing 
Got a bitch in my bed, in nothing but a g string, so peep game
Who the lucky female to taste these, snips and snails and puppy dog tails huh
You're messing with me, I'm messing with you, I'm a dog trick
I chase cats like Peppy La Pu, dead on shit
My life's like a Holiday Inn, if my girl act up
I'm gunna fuck her friend, if I'm a what...

Redman
I'm a dog motherfucker, I walk on all fours
Find where you live at, shit on your porch, Redman is hungry
Don't leave the food out, I'm pumped like a Pamela Anderson boob job
Straight up bulldog, mixed with a Shizhsu
cause I bullshit, party a little bit
Swim with the shark, you're bound to drown
My weed is like green, and yours brown
The doctor the dog, from Cali to Georgia
When cats meow with noting on top they halter
I don't have Yemen that laugh when I laugh
We some dogs, we can kiss our own ass
Like a golden retriever, retrieving the chronic
The dose nose bitch, and no need to hide it   Redman a flirt
Always get my nuts stuck to the porch, like the dog on Joe Dirt

Snoop Dogg

Fish don't fry in the kitchen, bitch don't climb, keep bitching
Beans don't burn on the grill, 3, 4, 5
with the pimping, hoes get your pimps permission
Now pay attention, the big D O double to the G O
to the liquor store to crack a hoe and get some VO VO
And mix it with some pena colidino
then slip it on the bitch then I dip with all her c notes
Scandalous, yep bitch cause we know
every pretty hoe always down to pull a d low
On me No, so there wont be no shaking me down, breaking me down, here we go
You know I'm just oh so slick
the way you chew that bubble gum, the way you sucking a dick
And I can tell, that you a freak
I wanna stick some dick up in you can I skeet, skeet
Don't you know why

Missy Slim Shady 4X

Eminem
Well I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
and pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode
and punch a bitch in the nose, til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches
I'm that vicious to walk up, and drop kick midgets
They call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Comin through the airport, sluggish, walkin on crutches
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out
I'm lookin for someone of to beat the crap out
I'm bringin you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French, then translate in English
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
speakin so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it

Missy Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady
Shady Yeah
Missy Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim motherfuckin Shady
Shady Yeah
Missy Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady
Shady Yeah
Missy Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. 

Eminem
I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically one more time
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Covered in throw up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown up to shut up SHUT UP
I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got a impulse
to give you insults wrote with a pencil bitch
and waste the paper on you, choppin down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin
You motherfuckers are puttin your words together for nuttin

Missy Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim Shady
Shady What's the deal
Missy Won't you busa rhyme for me boy .. Slim motherfuckin Shady
Shady Yeah.. who

A person from another planet might disagree with you
Well if you want my opinion, it comes from right here on Earth

Eminem
Slim Shady.. Misdemeanor..
Timbaland.. Slim Shady..
Misdemeanor..

I'm homicidal, and suicidal with no friends
Holdin a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin tecs at you until you see your fuckin legs
with the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin next to you
AHH  Fuckin mad dog, foamin at the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house, is foamin at the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
and shot every window out on the way down to the ground KEEP FILMING
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped em in half
Suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit if I get any higher, I'ma get the East and West beefin again
Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

Missy
Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy  Get back
Uhh, I'ma put you all in the line
Uhh, and I'ma watch you MC's die
Yo mommy, mommy, Missy done lost her mind

Yo, I'ma have to bust you through your chest and

It's rainin rainin and it's pourin loud
Never fear, cause pissy Missy's through the crowd
Uhh, I hear the gats go cha pow
Who shot me damnit  Bitch get down
Don't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile uh huh
Lay em on down, like they lived underground uh

Get your ass, kicked later, or get your ass, kicked now

Uhh.. one two
Misdemeanor, Slim Shady
Timbaland, motherfucker

Cool, cool, cool

Nicki Minaj

Bitches tune switchin up, we take 'em to Jiffy now
I'm thicker than peanut butter, he nuttin like Skippy now
He want me to be his wife, his  Misses  like  sippi  now, uh

Eminem
She invites me to the condo
My side piece, but she's also
someone's wife, so time we spend is borrowed
But it's our moment right here, fuck tomorrow
Cause moments like these are to die/dye for
And she's Clairol,  Nice and Easy  as hair, when I'm bleaching it blonde so
We got that lightning in a bottle
... She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder, sits on the sofa
I go to load a Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on, she goes
All that old school hip hop is over; think that shit's got pneumonia
I told her, Bitch now just hold up
That's why rap needs a doctor, our genre's lymph nodes are swollen up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital, we need  Q Tip  for the culture speed it up a little bit
You ain't dealin with a fuckin featherweight, I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake, I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen I'll make the motherfucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella, wait I gotta set a date
with the devil and celebrate
together we can renovate and re develop, hell awaits and I'ma get a special place~
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
like I'm a meteorite, and motherfuck the fuckin media right in the
behind, I'm a human encyclopedia, I must be
like pie crust because I was bread/bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights, they're just too high to reach
And I ain't even reached my fuckin highest
You better, pick another game, try hide and seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat, cause you gotta open your eyes to peek/peak
Am I indeed the last of a dyin breed Even if you fire breathe
Ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
if you wrapped your entire Mead pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
Better not use me as your topic, anybody who brings me up duck it
Let me keep it 100, two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband, last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

Nicki Minaj
Yo, now let me hit you back, told 'em I'd get you back
I know you sittin there just thinkin 'bout who did you that
I am who did you that, you trippin, did you pack
Can't post on Nicki block unless you sellin Nicki crack

Gotta be dumb to make me your rival rival
Cause I'm too powerful cause I'm too powerful

So say your prayers cause you 'bout to die slow die slow

Jealousy is a disease, die slow die slow
Die slow die slow die slow
Tell her, that jealousy is a disease, die slow die slow

Nicki Minaj

So far ahead, these bums is laggin
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin
I'm startin to feel like a dungeon dragon
RAHHH RAHHH, like a dungeon dragon

Eminem
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted ass mind got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you slut so wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turnin, spin the wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie rod
Quit hollerin Why God He ain't got shit to do with it, bygones
will never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin my wad
I ain't finished blowin it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blond white broad
with fake tits and a bad dye job
who just spit in my fuckin face and called me a fuckin tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
and caught her stealin my music, so I tied her arms
and legs to the bed, set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treatin you like dry sod
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
The world, world, is my punchin bag and
If I'm, garbage you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

Nicki Minaj
I i i i i i i i is this the thanks that I get for puttin you bitches on
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone
Should've sent a Thank You note, you little hoe
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow

Well bitch, if you ain't shittin then get off the pot

Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke   gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer

Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
She don't remember shit  Just the two hits
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits
Suckin on the tits  Had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick

Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, B I G
Then I bust in her E Y E Yo Big, you're dead wrong

Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me   my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
but Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin with
Anybody step into my path is fuckin feelin it
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push.. me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
with no hair in between, know what I mean

PuffLadies and gentlemen..

Gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor
The rap slayer
The hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers
Hail Mary, full of grace
Smack the bitch

And her North Face off her back
Jab her if she act
Funny with the money, oh, you got him mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya
I just want the paper
The Visa
Kapeesha
I'm out like
The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho
The head honcho
Swift fist like
Cumacho

Much style, I should be down with The Stylistics
Make up to break up
Niggas need to wake up
Smell the indonesia
Beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit
Just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor
And me hittin' the clits
Suckin' on the tits
Had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't, ugly, love
My dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House Of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was Humpin' Around and Jump in Around
Jacked her, then I asked her, Who's the man
She said, B.I.G.
Then I bust in her E Y E Yo B.I.G., you're dead wrong

How many licks does it take to the center of my Tootsie Roll Or
How many nuts to the center of your booty hole
Hold on, shorty, cause I'm about to slap this groupie nigga
Jab this fluesy nigga, watch 'em bleed, then shit dookie, nigga
Spooky nigga, you gettin' skinny like you Pookie, nigga
Blood spill got you laggin' out like that soupie nigga
Smoke this Lucy nigga, time passin' on the frank mic
Watch 'em dyin' slow, then see ya skin, you start to change color
My goons lay the flood, leave you layin', drippin' blood
Then ended up fingerfuckin' your mother at a strip club
We dead wrong for how we gutter like how in the sudden
Fascinated how all of this street shit, we straight mother
Fuck it
We thug rugged to the tenth power
Like B.I.G. was listenin'
So Gimme The Loot for the past ten hours
Another dick
Hear the click of my gun cock
Same mentality when I was scheeming on a lunch box
Gimme that
Twenty focused and I'm sorry Campbell
I'm taking from you and your wife and run the baby Pamper What

Ih.. ih, ih it has been
It has been, it has been, it has been
It has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money power respect, street cred, yeah
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re enact
these tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entou rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

Since B.I.B. taught us niggaz to think big
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencin the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rollin, goin through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
Palmin that forty five, plottin to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I.

I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace...
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother...
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yellin God bless
Regardless to critics yellin that East/West
And when the ressurection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally
I'ma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga

Obie Trice
Babe uh, yeah
Girl, you my only one though aight, haha
You my baby, fuck all that shit
You're the one for me
Check it out.

Baby I'm feeling the feelings you giving, I'm feelin your style
And I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out
I'm picturing your figure in a swimsuit wiling
Somewhere in the Caribbean Islands
Cause the vibe you giving me now
Feels like I'm an innocent child
Sinning is never tempting when other womens around
Hands down, this is my vow
I never heard a moan sound so profound
When a nigga's digging you out, phone rings
You cuss them motherfuckers out, quit calling the house
If I call, you're in route
There's a drought, you look out
I'm on edge, you put the palm of your hand on my head and squeeze
Please believe I ain't scared of commitment
Fuck head from them bitches
When you could do the same, but that respect is given
Our intimacy is significantly different

You gon ride for me you gon ride
Then I'm gon ride for you I'm gon ride
If you put your mouth on me put it on me
I'm a put my mouth on you
Together there ain't nothing we can't do there's nothing
Any problem we can see it through we see it through
Baby if you promise to be true you promise
I will never put my hands on you
Come on and think about it

We ain't even got to talk when we see each other
We got it all chalked out when we see each other under them covers
You my lover, I'm your friend, I'm your man, but I'm sayin
Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand
Visions of you having my little man
We joke, you call me George Foreman
Cause I'm namin him O number four, me I'm three
Plus the ol' G like the personality, she say it's meant to be
I'm in the bathroom when you pee
She in the bathroom too when a nigga doo doo, you my boo boo
There's nothing in this world that a nigga wouldn't do to
Satisfy   this my bitch that ride
My bitch wit the pistol in the ride
A nigga act up she busting, she ain't got to decide
No discussion, she'll put a slug in a tough niggaz muffin
You're fucking wit her husband

Come on and think about it
You got a ring about it
Nothing could ever come between or intervene our bondage
Drama we overcome it if we out numbered
I promise it'll be us against a hundred
Rushing to your side when you vomit eating pickles and peanutbutter
Eight months later Obie rubbing your stomach
Paying homage to your momma for raising a girl proper
Enough to call O her Baby Father
You ain't gotta bother bout a deal, I swear I keep it real
Raise young O trill and cook a decent meal
It's signed and sealed, you the only female
Hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail
Post bail and post up for sale
I swore, I swear we will always live well
Long as I got my bombshell from the hood to the hills
Who's gon stop up nobody we's that deal

Bridge   Eminem Obie Trice
If you gon stand by me if you gon stand by me
Then I'm gon stand by you then I'm gon stand by you
If you promise you'll be true
Then I'll never put my hands on you hands down
But don't you play me for no fool no fool bitch
Cause if I put my mouth on you on you
After you put your mouth on someone else
Better find someone else new
Come on and think about it

Yeah.. Obie Trice

I love bein hated, it great
It let's me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way
I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only let's me know that I'm loved 
by so many other motherfuckers that ain't you
And is bomb, as you keep fuckin with us, we keep fuckin you up
And keep pullin the rug from up under you
And what's even more fucked up, is we enjoy what were doin
so much there ain't nothin that we love more than  Pullin Your Skirts Up 
And exposin you hoes so much, people are startin to wonder
what's up with them fuckin one dough a man under rules
Do on to others as you will have done under you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
You gonna ask yourself, how come your mans 
didn't enter that last round that he had in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance
You keep askin us to keep it on wax but we can't
This is past any rationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start buildin
soon as we enter the '106th & Park' building
Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God 
if someone so much as even touches one of my people
I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's because I ain't a bitch, I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general, I ain't Bush, I don't send my soldiers to war
If I ain't there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when I do get 'em
Orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fuckin with a ..

Swifty McVay
Fuckin with a piece keeper, see you a nigga that greet this lyrical meat cleaver
That'll eat ya, niggaz wanna keep speakin, like it ain't even that deep
See I wouldn't fuck with me neither, only heaven can help ya
I'll be searchin for you longer than the Legend of Zelda
Without a failure, there's gonna be hell to tell the
captain that a bassett hound couldn't even smell ya
body, when I hide ya, I be on that mob shit
You another Hoffa, under the Renaissance bitch
I snatch your head like one of Saddam's wigs

Obie Trice
Motherfucker, I'll handle you
We can have it out on any Avenue
A  Average Man  flipped into an animal
Shoot out your mandibles
Cannons and ammunition, reload with precision 
Nigga know the mechanicals
Break a pistol down, you should see them handles
The street taught the child, no read up manuals
Pushin crack vows, young Nino Brown
Chasin green is the dream, when your young and brown
Bound to be a problem child, look what I'm involved in now
A 'Dozen Dirty' niggaz and they all get down
Dissolve any problem that enlarge with ours
Eminem: c'mon

Kuniva
While your punchin and tacklin punks
I'm handlin chumps, packin a pump
On the streets I'm a beast, I feast upon the weak
So speak beef, I'll shot you and scream increase the peace
A monster, pistol packin pushin niggaz off they Hondas
Stomp ya, get it crackin, yankin bitches for they ganja
Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough
When she was sleep and stuff, I was stealin the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up, before you end up dead in the dump truck
Or in the streets takin a nap, bleedin and lumped up
Who Want What  like M. Bleek, with this heat if you ten deep

Proof
Don't muscle with my a land ski
Don't tustle with my hand speed
Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed
We ferocious, toast no holsters
We the soldiers, y'all the youngsters ha
Upstairs the Munster, hand full of drama
I'm back nigga Proof, I reappear
Blackness, carcass covered with cat fish
We murkers with no purpose other than practice bitch

Bizarre
There's three things I hate: liars, fakes and cheaters
Alcoholics, sluts and fuckin wife beaters
A gat that describes my life damn
Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip hop
This Ja Rule beef I ain't gettin in
I'll need an R & B singer to sing at my wedding
I turn your face into a fuckin meat patty
I'll fuck your mommy and go fishin with your granny
I'll  Shit on You , I'll pee on R. Kelly too
This is Bizarre, see you Devil's Night 2

Obie Trice
Yeah.. Trice, Statik Selektah

O back around the corner
Got the crack, put in your orders, we 'bout to run up out the stores
It's  Notorious  the way I got  Big  spittin stories
BME's X Clan,  Vanglorious 
We not your favorite fuck it, you know the system and you buck it
Have you revisitin, how you used to love it
A nigga spew through the music acoustics
Cool kid, used to pursue excuses
Truth is I was truant in school
So his influence is foolish, that was my views
I'm back at it, the rap addict by any means
We gon' get these stacks accurate, no skinny jeans
Say he ain't a star, niggaz might be right
I'm so regular, nigga got his shit tonight
Bring it back Selektah, let 'em know it's Trice
Put your seatbelts on, we gon' ride tonight

Eminem
Chka chk chka chk, and I would like
'Bout get my Ike on, I come with a life supply of wife
beaters and my Nikes on, and a white tee over that Iron Mike
Lookin fly tonight, feelin like I might die from a spider bite
Come back as Spider Man,  Park  my  Peter  inside a dyke
Bitch actin like she got fuckin higher standards than Meijer's, right
Had to pry her fingers off of the motherfuckin Breyers ice 
cream with the pliers like AHHH only a ruthless bastard would do this
Take a toothless bitch with no taste buds to Ruth's Chris
Give her toothpicks, and stop on the way home pick up two big Bufords
Scrupulous girl you got a nice pair, but you're plum stupid
So when I pull up in that Benz don't try to pretend you ain't interested
to impress your stupid ass friends and refuse to get in, woman
and get slammed on the ground and SNAP like a pool stick against, cement
If you should get dick, pretend like it's a musical instrument
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I can tell at first glance you're a hoe, cause your pants are so
tight when you dance with O. Trice your implants explode
So cold to dykes the chance of snow, in San Francisco
Well I'm from Detroit City, you live in animosity
That's a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity
Look where these random thoughts get me, it's senseless mind babble
And I wouldn't fuckin take it back if I TIME TRAVELLED

Just call me Richard, Richard
Cause I'm a dick, dick
It's also Richard cause I feel like 
you should pry your fuckin mouth up off of it, it hah
I said just call me Richard, Richard yea
Cause I'm a dick, dick yea
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates it's your first clue, Sherlock prick
Just call me Richard, Richard

Obie Trice
That's my motives, jumpin out the Rovers
All white like I was right up in the Dakotas
or Minnesota; did I mention soda
When it's mixed with the yola watch my cup runneth over
Cut from a soldier, from holdin a disposable toaster
Puttin holes in a nigga gettin close enough
BME 'til the credits roll
So my condition is beyond what the medics know
They wanna edit O
Like a prosthetic third leg, let it go
This is Shady 1.0, Em let 'em know
I still profit through the process
The prize in my jeans, my balls'll never digress
I'm a dick that I brag about
I put it in fast and then I drag it out
World, I'll be your special friend see
So

Yeah, SHADY
Guess who's back
Still here, haters
Whatcha gonna do it with it, A
Whatcha gonna do

I keep the 40 cal on my side
Steppin with the mindstate of the mobster
See a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya
Got glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything you need, believe me, I'm gon lace you
Just don't whatever you do, Snitch
Cause you will get hit, pray I don't lace you, yeah

Obie Trice
It's risky, the bitch tend to rise out a nigga
It's history, Snitch, who decided he's a member
Once he got pinched, coincided with law
Same homie say he lay it down for the boy
Brought game squad around ours
How could it be Been homies since Superman draws
Only foniness never came to par
He had us, a true neighborhood actor
Had his back with K's
Now we see through him like X Ray's
Cuffed in that Adam car
No matter, his loss, we at him, it's war
Knowing not to cross those resevoir dogs
You helped plant seeds just to be a vegetable
When we invest in team, it's to the death fo sho
No ex and oh's, tex calicos
Aim at your chest nicca

Obie Trice
We started out as a crew, when one speak, it's all honest
Private conferences when we eat, Benihana's
Reconnaissance when we peep enemies on us
Been on these corners, sellin like anything on us
Knowing heaven has shown us being devil's minors
But that ain't got shit to do with the tea in China
We gon keep the grind up til death come find us
Meantime leaning in them European whips reclined up
It's eye for an eye for the riders
We ain't trying to get locked up, we soul survivors
Po po's is cowards, there's no you, it's ours
We vow this, mixing yayo with soda powder
Who woulda known he would fold and cower
Once the captain showed, he sold whole McDonalds
So no exs and ohs, tex calicos
Aim at your chest nicca

Obie Trice
Nowadays, Sammy Da Bull's got the game full
So he move to a rural area to keep cool
He snitchin on a snitch now, there's nothin to tell
Nowadays, your circles should be small as hell
Ain't tryin to meet new faces, this don't interest me
Even if we bubble slow, we'll get it eventually
No penitentary, there will be no climacy
You will meet the lowest snitch in given us a century
These cats is rats now, the streets need decon
That's how they react now, weak when the heat's on em
Stop snitchin, you asked for the life your living
This act is not permitted, Nowhere on the map, It is
Forbidden to send a nigga to prison if you been in it
Along with em and then snitch and become hidden
So it's no exs and ohs, techs calicos
Aim at your chest nicca

Obie Trice
You rat bastard

Yeah
Ay, Em, you ready
Herc, you got them thangs nigga you know
Detroit city

There they go, them D town boys carry the Calico
Whenever there's war, you gotsta know
Them boys got toys tear down the front door
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

You are not convincing
When Detroit blocks stay flocked with henchmen
Niggaz get popped for instance, infrared dot for distance
Get knocked by the cops, cop on some pen shit
Straight detention, a nigga doing tension
Once released he on that music buisness
When viewing 106 and them cafeterias
Only to find that rap's actually serious
Deliriously resort back to crack and vigilence
Same shit that sent em upper Michigan
Us is pimping, a difference, from any city I visited
It's that Detroit spirit and if we in it, balling out till the ending, period
Use O as a reference to that sentence
The message I'm sending you, best just pay attention

If you don't like how I act then blow me
I don't really give a shit, I represent the real cats who know me
Man what's up with that scratch you owe me
Now run my chips before we fall out like Shaq and Kobe
Big Herc on a track with Obie, when you come to the D
It's cut throat, better be packing homie
And niggaz get they shit split for acting phonie
We're known for the glocks and the choppas
These niggaz'll rob you, leave you standing in ya socks and ya boxers
We got real G's and lots of imposters
I smoke the real trees, see I cop from the rastas
Ya'll niggaz ain't impress me yet
Ya'll yapping, not rapping, turn that shit off and press eject
See we known for the car shows, running from the narcos
Keep them bottles coming, we gon pop em till the bar close

Meat cleaver, leave a gas in a bitches ass
See her dreams of being an R&B singer diva
Leave her face, cut her from the waist
Ah man what a waste, of a pretty face
And this place ain't just safe, it's just straight gangsta
It ain't just New York or L.A. that pains no more
There's Latin Coun' Kings here
Southside, four, East Side and Gansen
Nuthin but ganglands and, spray paint cans
And when that van rolls up, man they ain't glancing
That window rolls down and that tre eight's dancing
And them shooters don't miss, homie they hate chancing
Straight for the dome and it's vacate fast and
Get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue Dodge flashing
Red and blue lights, no ambulance, you got flattened
And this was not supposed to be no Detroit anthem
But just so ya know, if ya see them D Boys passing

Here we go motherfuckers
This the motherfuckin back acha Trick
Don't even dream of fucking up in Detroit, bitch
This is where the real killers at
Detroit motherfucker
Ain't never no difficulty smashing no bitch ass niggaz
Matter of fact, bring your bitch ass to Detroit nigga
We got something for your ass
Gun shots fade out

Skam:
Yo I'm tryin to be the man of the day
Three six five a year
See the bullshit you sayin, Skam ain't tryin to hear Fuck that
Bustin lyrics in the air
Keepin some up in the chamber

Eminem:
Yo Skam, what the fuck you doin

Skam:
Man, I'm releasin anger

Eminem :

Three six five a year
See that bullshit you sayin, Shady ain't tryin to hear
Spittin lyrics in your ear
Keepin some up in the chamber

Skam:
Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doin

Shady: 
I'm releasin anger

Man I'm tired of bein tired, everytime I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin, and endin up datin sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make up, wake up
Gold diggin bitches, the buck stops here 
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fittin, girl leave that shit alone
You aint Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone
I rip your tissue out your ear
Spittin like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't come it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the hoe now
At every industry party, gettin so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin to roll up on Miami, leavin with a broke neck
Oh shit, leathal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin up white rappers like im throwin gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposin the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber 
Yo Skam what the fuck you doin

Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Became late to the last show with a different dane
Brain ate from the last ode that I snifed the cane
Yo know your spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your pukus, turnin to yellow with orange mukus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genuis, too extreme for the weak and squeemish
Burn you alive till you screamin to be extinquished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M 16 burstin
You gettin spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin  
On the B side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life when you still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney speciman from a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your rushin sternly eternally
I'll take it back before we knew each others name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to lovers lane, to the night you were started 
Cock block your fathers game 
I'll plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left, then to hope out
I'ma throw a head but so hard, I'll knock us both out

Dunk your head in Clorox, use your dreads for my floor mop
Gay or straight, my Papermate'll do a date rape
Zee can't wait, I'll go Great Bank on a blank tape
Lost like Spigg Nice, stick you for your thick ice
Good to hit twice 'fore you catch me usin' trick dice
Go to parole off of two in stolen wheels
My colon holdin' pills, fuck takin' some Golden Seal
I smoke leaky and black like BET
And fuck hoes raw dog 'til my balls catch VD
Mess with us, straight up, y'all better bust
I'm the one you'll never dust, it's still the same as it ever was
I'll leave the crowd in a Coupe with white walls
And scream, If y'all ain't Outz then y'all could ride my balls
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850 I
I fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets me high
Mama se, Mama sa, Mama macosa
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama se, Mama sa, Mama macosa
Mama se, Mama sa, Ma macosa
Mama se, Mama sa, Ma macosa
Mama se, Ma sa, Ma macosa
Mama se, Mama sa, Ma macosa

Slang Ton
Yo, all the boys in the lobby get needles filled with poison ivy
Put 'em in the hospital and give 'em a poison IV
My crew get high much off brew and Thai skunk
It makes my style off the wall like suicide jumps
We sip lots of liq' shots
It makes my hip hop fat as your lip got when I
kickboxed with flip flops
And give a disk jockey six copies of this floppy
Shit I be dyin' for is your piece of shit hobby
You borin' like Oran Dice, I'm more than hype
Bungee jumpin with cordless mics, for tourists sites
Ton Slanga, I'm dopin', pills and cokin'
Lung cancer in my throat and still smokin'

Az izz
Now, when your partner die, who got the right
To do the homicide and you shot the guy
And when you's 'bout to cry who got you high
Say Mama se, Mama sa, Mama macosa
I'll blast the guy that don't pass the lye
Leave him paralized and agonized
Fellas, grab the thighs that's by your side
Say Mama se, Mama sa, Mama macosa

D.U.
Mama se, Mama sa, Mama maco
Mama se, Mama sa, Mama maco
Mama se, Mama sa, Mama maco
Mama se, Mama sa, Mama maco

Pace Won
Wanna live this Outsida business
Blunt splitters, all that
Multiple musical contracts to fallback...
On... set like I was Liu Kang for Kombat...
Armed like Emmit when I rush crews
More hardcore than DMC and Krush Groove
Don't need hands to touch you
Mr. Perfect, the one you want to rap like
The name rap fiends have in their mouth like a crack pipe
Slap the fuck out you, remember us
I'm the man your father never was, or could've been
Maybe if they passed out weed in high school, I would've went
Got it down, yo
Even if you sing like Brownstone you couldn't Take The Crown Home
Try to call me out and get the dial tone
Pace Woner, dickin' 5 0 in a stolen gray Hummer

Eminem
Me and Pace had to flee in haste from bein' chased
For some E & Js we boosted out of some Korean place
I get drunk and hang glide off of St. Ides'
And spray paint the plain sides of all the subway train rides
I got a pitbull that eats sheep and spits wool
And chews on human body tissue 'til its stomach gets full
Skip school, barely went to class, thinkin' shit's cool
Hid a loaded pistol under this retarded kid's stool
I had a dream I blew up with half a mil' sold
And still stole a credit card, a purse, and someone's billfold
I'm from the city where the weather's always real cold
And chill mode can turn into somebody gettin' steel toed
We be hangin' on the block 'til dawn
Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon
Feelin' for the beats like they Chaka Khan
Mama se, Mama sa, Mama macosa
Pace Won, Slang Ton, and Yah
Young Zee, Az Izz, D.U., and muah
Bizarre Kid, Loon One and Rah
Mama se, Mama sa, Mama macosa

Young Zee
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850 I
We fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets us high
Mama se, Mama sa, Mama macosa
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama se, Mama sa, Mama macosa
Mama se, Ma sa, Ma macosa
Mama se, Ma sa, Ma macosa
Mama se, Ma sa, Macosa
Mama mama mama mama macosa

Pace Won
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what
Outz in the area tearing things up Sing it with me
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what
Outz in the area tearing things up 

Az Izz
Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence
Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence
Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event
Outz in a fear of family presents
Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat
To roast motherfuckers, over lactose 
Stay skeed off laced weed
I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks
Rolling box of Tracies

Pace Won
Call a go go dancer
Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer
Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up
Once for my cock, twice for my block, 
I got it locked like handcuffs
Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut
Swing a blow you can't duck
Throw up your hands, what
Nobody on earth could see Pacer
I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer

Slang Ton
I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie
Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack bologna
And if you ever wanna get a deal
You should either OD off skill pills
Or steal my reel to reel
Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when
I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints
Outsidaz, we hot as Hell's flames is
And I'm Slang iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges

Eminem
I'm so weeded How weeded are you
I'm so weeded I can freestyle for sixteen bars Ha ha ha
Right off the top, then go back to the top
And then repeat it Ha
Write it down on the paper 
And still be able to read it Sorry
I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals Uh, uh, dear
I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds Whee
I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out
I been down with the Outz for ten thou sand years 
Pace Won So dunn, here
Some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear
Lauryn, huh  Hill 
Pace won There's more than one IIIllll
What You want me to stop Here

Young Zee
Yea
Your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red
Till she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dick head
Puff a tray bag, Outz never pay cabs
Bust a A rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave 
Yea, we all of the a volumes
What be the outcome 
We selling twenty million albums
Ay your record, ain't nobody buy that
You fell off, and had to take your five mic 
And push a white Ac, with a bike rack

Axe
It's the A, the X, the E
Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free
F' with we, what you expect to see
Death's your destiny, when it's my time for rest in peace
Bet they find my pistol next to me
My dick is giving ecstasy 
Shit I say, spread like leprosy
I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee
Living recklessly, cock the weaponry
Lay you on your back like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3
Yo follow, never question me

Pace Won
C'mon yo
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what
Snuff your bitch, crush your whip, what
Outz in the area tearing things up

Outworld baby

Proof
Aiyyo, she a freak and I love the way she move to the beat
Ass and titties bouncin, she ain't movin her feet
Put 20 in her bra, stiff dick had many in her jaw
Probably hit plenty in the raw nasty bitch
I wanna see this bitch naked on my livin room flo'
And yo bitch, I ain't givin up no dough, fo'sho'
You can be my best friend but Em might get mad
Don't call me Daddy bitch, I fuck better than your dad
Let me get up in that ass like I'm ridin horseback
Fuck a sponge, I need a tool to clean my ball sack
I pop my collar, don't pop your bra strap
If you hang up the phone then bitch don't call back
18's on ice, you ain't seen that befo'
Actin like you ain't seen my bling through the do' bling
I move to a ho, just for one reason
Cause bitches need 9 1 1 for no reason

I'm somethin like a pimp
I said I'm somethin like a pimp
Can't go on trips, so you could suck my dick, yes bitch
I'm somethin like a pimp
You could swallow or spit, and make me rich, oh girl
I'm somethin like a pimp
Get that money witcha switch, I walk with a limp, big P
Said I'm somethin like a pimp

Kuniva
I never treat 'em like they wanna be treated, bitch beat it
Your purpose'll be defeated if you think that you're needed
Now what do you tell a chick who has two black eyes
You ain't gotta tell her nothin, you just told her twice
And I don't wanna put my hands on ya, I got a plan for ya
Get with my mans, he gon' lay a couple grand on ya
So fresh and so clean, she know the routine
It's such a   wonderful thing, money flow like ravines
They say Kuniva, get a clothin line but I'ma chill
Cause when cotton ain't sellin pussy always will
And these women they be knowin the deal
That's why these niggaz be blowin a mil' just to keep a ho in they grill
And I ain't never been a pimp, I'm somethin like one though
I fuck 'em and leave 'em, you always love or like that ho
Cashin 'em out, they never get ahold of my chains
They only get that swollen up thang, I'm showin 'em game

Swifty McVay
Hah, you was a sucka when you met her, she dogged you cause you let her
See I tell a bitch quick, if you knew better you'd do better bitch
They realizin I ain't havin that shit
Don't be surprised, I'm hypnotizin every tramp that she with
I send 'em out like Vanity 6 and I mean that
I'm doggin they ass, I'm in joggin pants and a V neck hah
I put my foot up in her ass so fast
that she'll forget how to spell cash, she hoe'in with a cast on
And I'm knowin just what happened that day
He didn't pay cause you let him take you to a matinee I saw you
You get slapped that way, you can't dodge the drama
I'm pimpin aunts and mamas, I collect from massage parlors want my change
Menage a trois is really second nature
And uh, I can give a fuck about a relation
Either open your legs, or get the play, stupid bitch

Eminem
Hey, you know I gotta say somethin on this track.

Well I'm not a pimp or a player, see I'm more like the mayor
Grab a bitch up by her hair like I just don't care
and swing her in the air AHH I'm talkin major ass kick
Toss a bitch out the house like Kwame Kirkpatrick
I'm a PIMP, so I give a fuck about a BITCH
But I don't make 'em trick, I'm RICH whoo
I don't need the chips, they don't walk the strip
But I could spit some game and I could talk some shit
I'm somethin like a pimp, similar to a mack
I ain't makin the news, I make my baby mama pick up the slack
That's my bottom ho pagin me back   I'm a pimp

Bizarre
It's 7 o'clock, bitch you ain't got my money
Bitch get on the block in some dirty tube socks
and get shot by a cop in some Reeboks yeah
Bitch I'm the man, you know I'm the man
Keep suckin dick, 'til you get a hundred grand
Bitch you insane if you think I'm your mayn
Here's 2 G's, go fuck LeBron James

Hah, been gettin this money off these bitches
Heard me  That's what I do, you know me
Check me out anywhere, anybody tell you about Proof
Got that, a.k.a. The Young Legend
The Human Fly, y'knowmsayin
Aiyyo, I got bitches in Michigan on Michigan
Yo' bitch is on Woodward nigga, next to them faggot ass niggaz
I got bad bitches cause you gon', you think it's a cop
Yeah, that ain't cop that's my bitches
I got the top notch bitches, y'knowmsayin
I'm more than a pimp, I'm somethin like a pimp
Big pimpin, you heard me  P.I.M.P
Proof Is My Poppa, let's keep it goin
Proof Is My Poppa, P.I.M.P
Y'knowmsayin let's go, c'mon y'all let's go..

Traci Nelson
Ooh, hey.. ooh, hey.. ooh, hey..

All these niggaz talkin 'bout what they gon' kill
Heard you caught a misdemeanor then I heard you squeal
Holdin hands with the D.A. while you made your deal
Three thousand miles away and I could hear you still
Half these niggaz snitchin yo and that's for real
I know it's hard to swallow, that's a big ol' pill
If I catch you motherfuckers you gon' catch some steel
I know it might sound crazy, that's the way I feel

Proof
Uhh, trace this to it's basis, no movie script
No yay, no pounds, no uzi clips
Not a car, no bling, know a bougie bitch
You got all of these rappers sayin they movin bricks
They whole cliques switch with boob and tits
If you're   truly bitch, then they'll   usually snitch
In a roundabout way I say my toolies spit
But if it come to coppin a plea, it includes the fifth
The mood is flipped cause spirits see the diaphragms
Gangsta rappers with murderers for hired hands
Police and riot vans, callin us pirate clans
Government guide hands, with private plans
To damage the game, it's a shame to survive a scam
Cause we high off liquor, bitches and Vicadin
Yell out we gon' strike again, so triflin
Got kids idlin the vest to riflin look Ma
Why you make a fake life in pens
Glorify the hood but never a Bible hymn
And as the streets keep tyin in
Until the Feds indict the fans just for buyin in, where's the violin

Swifty McVay
Hah, are you the guy that told the guy that I'm the guy that gave the guy
a half a P; now the police is after me
Askin me questions, tellin me shit you only knew
Pulled up on me out the blue, all this shit because of you
Watch to do somethin cool bitch, snitchin like Samuel Bull
Now yo' life's fucked up, and I'm announcin you responsible
And I'm cut the fuck up, and whatchu gonna do but sit yo' ass there
So what  Ain't nothin fair
When a nigga like you get carried away without your lips
I drop you off and get lost, come back the same day
witcho' tongue cut off nigga, it's cursed anyway
You the one who can't count, so give my G's up straight up
And when it comes to shootin you the one who freeze up
That's why yo' broke ass could swallow these nuts
and folks ask, tryna follow everything that reads up
on your report you made, I will escort you to your grave
Tryna see me behind bars so you can get paid
That's negative, you threaten my life  I CAN'T let you live

Proof
If you aim for slugs that's blazed by killers
Now the game done changed these niggaz out here praisin squealers
Go Proof   my behavior's iller when tellin the truth
Expunge my gun nigga like any paid felon'll do
My spoken is well in the truth, you in hell and the Proof
From the block to the jail or the booth
Bod boy image shall illuminate in silence
Gangsta, one that communicates through violence
Go Proof   not through yappin or hostile rappin
All on TV vest up and glocks go flashin
It's all actin   y'all just
don't see the director behind the camera that yells out Action take one
Blowin off the door hinge to a world in orbit
Where the masses have supportive recorded performance
There's enormous shortage of poor kids
with new deals, they will become distorted and tortured
And I ain't losin like 'Pac, there's rules on my block

Is he still alive
Yeah yeah, I think so
Alright great, let's sign him

Heh, aiyyo dig this
If you tell the masses, you tell the cops
But if that street yappin made you famous, then you a star
Star; hey, write down star
Write down star on a piece of paper
Hold it up in front of you, right in the mirror
Put it in the mirror
Hold it up in front of you, and that's YOU
Holla at me, fix it faggots..

It's however, it's whatever you like
If you that nigga tryna get ahead and you know you right
I see the Henny and I guess it's aight
Cause it ain't have the bars then take a step of your life

T 3
Yeah I stepped out the background when my nigga Dilla left
Didn't see the full picture, maybe just a rough sketch
Didn't know the dude for real, they knew a silhouette
Small portion who I was when I turned and looked back
Had a few tools, had to learn to work that
Plus they cut a nigga out, say I wasn't worth jack
The trials of your man, I'm not complainin
I'm sayin the truth y'all exactly how it's layin
So when you see me don't think it was easy
Things wasn't fair to me, your man T Threezy
I had to work to eat, I wasn't supposed to be
I did a flow like boats on seas
Now I'm the captain of my own destiny
I stand at the edge of this shit, control my feats
I rearrange things that could've remained bleak
Cause you ain't doin the same, don't mean you should hate me

Mudd
Damn, it's hard hustlin with your crew
when you the head of your troops and dudes don't wanna grow up
Attitude is so what, nig's out here killin 'em
Dude's draggin his feet, I ain't got time to deal with him
Look at the time dime, how many years it's been
since we moved back from Brooklyn
You lookin sorry dawg, pardon me I'm your mans, this ain't no diss
But I don't see no good in you if you don't handle yo' biz
Yo' angle is, is bored and stubborn
Quick to say fuck whoever and still want somethin for nothin
Streets talked about your loose lips, remember when Proof flipped
Threw a cassette tape at you, you ain't do shit
Exactly, I woulda been scrappin if that was me
When the Feds came to swoop you turned your back on T
I ain't sayin you snitch but your actions are smellin like fish
You still smackin your bitch, too old to be actin like this
Man chill

Proof
I ain't tryin to find no blame, or make excuses
I figured y'all slept so long I'll wake the rooster
I love hip hop and just makin music
In the 8 Mile flick I was portrayed as Future
On the set I was due, where's the rest of my crew
for the movie, this is truly our destiny dude
I'm like Shady is my team, maybe it's a dream
It seems I'm bein choked like Radio Raheem
P knew it when G Unit all got deals
Imagine a muscle have to hustle, that's why it feel
I'm walkin out of different people office still
This ain't a diss, this is just talkin real
Toy soldier, wonderin how they coffin feel
My homie put me on 'em but I got up off them pills
But ask 'em all how where the fuck what they'd be without me   Proof

Dirty Harry is dead x4
I'm here to announce that Dirty Harry is dead
Now witness the life of his son, or Oil Can Harry, The Boss

Proof
My life is trapped in these lines, that's why I'm packin' these nines
I gotta rap I ain't dyin', that's in the back on my mind
Got a strap made of iron, can't relax on this grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers til I'm snappin' my spine
Naturally, I gotta focus
On these bogus poachers, lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like soda
Hold up
Eminem We nothin' but soldiers
Slow up
Eminem This gun is loaded
Roll up
Eninem They beef and we leavin' 'em coked up
If Em say it I spray it, if he willin' I kill it
We kill packs to get iller Detroit, y'all can feel it
Got this gun on my wasteline, in war we don't waste time
Ja, man he can't take a punch and 50 can take nine
We got School Craft here at the 7, 8, and text her
I'm up in Holly, spendin' dollas, ain't feelin' no pressure
Yes sir, your texture is bitch, bet'cha ya flinch
When Proof shoot up they coup, and wet your whole clique
Fuck it who's next on this shit, this is prefrence to bitch
When you preface to stiffen slugs enter your wig
You'll be next to BIG, Pac is destiny kid
Before ya lead get popped, stop testin' me bitch

Homie you think you tough what
Think we won't fuck you up punk
Even the innocent get pistol whipped by this pistol grip punk
Talkin' shit you drunk what
Think I won't fuck you up punk
We both deep, I ain't scared and I don't give a fuck jump

Proof
I ain't feel no games, homie don't even try
We ain't bowin' down to no one we gon' start a riot yeah
Heart of fire, soul of ice, roll the dice, see what you get
No advice, all my life I ain't leavin' in this bitch
I'm a man, more I'm holdin' my ground
To loadin' these rounds, at any call approachin' my ground blah
I'm a kid but grimey, nothin' but killas
And behind me, I'm a bully fully cuz your team is tiny
If I was to crush 'em, got to say these Bibles are nothin'
This rifle on clutches to leave you stifled on crutches
I fight for my cousins that ain't even related
Even I stated, not from life I leave you bleedin' and faded
Hatin' made in my nature, I'm clappin' and clackin' your captain
Smackin' faggots and act as a rapper with platinum status, ya livin'
flappin' 'em slappin' 'em backwards
After these rappers' status
To shadders, knowin' Proof and that Mathers has gathered an army
It's Shady bandatas
After rest the game is won, who in the matters get blamed fast with brain damage
The name that some forgot, D12, it ain't hard to feel, guard ya grill, it's REAL

Rihanna
On the first page, of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out, so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have, their wicked schemes
And you take that, to new extremes
But you'll always be, my hero
Even though you've lost, your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, ohhhh
I love the way you lie...

Rihanna
Now there's gravel, in our voices
Glasses shatter from, the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words, and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
are what keeps me satisfied

Rihanna
Ohhhhhhhh ohhh
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls, are goin up
in smoke with all, our memories

Eminem
This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Shhhh Hush baby speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby without you I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that shove me, in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
that we'll have each other's backs, cause we're that lucky
Together we move mountains
Let's not make mountains out of molehills, you hit me twice, yeah but who's countin
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love, is crazy we're nuts, but I refuse counselin
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
Cause with you I'm in my fuckin mind, WITHOUT YOU I'M OUT IT~

Rihanna
I love the way you lie...
I love the way you lie...

Rihanna
Ecstacyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
In the air... I don't care
Can't tell me noth iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing
I'm impaired... the worse for wear

Cause I'm goin numb, I'm goin numb
I'm goin numb, I'm goin numb
I'm goin numb, I'm goin numb
I'm goin numb, I'm goin numb
I'm goin

Rihanna
Can't you seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Ain't it clear ... I don't care
Get closer to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
If you dare... I double dare

Eminem
I'm plastered drywall look me in my eyeball
Yeah yeah yeah; c'mere dear, I'm tryin to get closer to you
I'm motionin you to pull over boo
I'm the siren that you hear hear
I'm the butt police, and I'm lookin at your REAR REAR REAR
But odds are I'ma end up in the back of a squad car by the end of tonight
I'm a rock star, get your wind up, it's attack of the oddball
Homie can ya show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
cause I'm sick of sniffin asphalt, every thought's scarred
Got my pants off at the crosswalk in suspenders
And I can't feel my limbs cause

You will not be able to stay home, brotha
You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised

King Green
This right here for the number one
Number one shit with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now e'rybody sayin that they number one

Ring the alarm
The caterpillar keeps firing, ohhh
We in the war
Where butterflies keep dyin, ahhh

Royce Da 5'9
I'm a product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak
If I didn't do this, where in the fuck would you be at
See there's a difference between us, what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis, I eat lions and sip hyenas
You number one when it come to slaughtered mics
I'm tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uhh, all you niggaz my little rapper babies
Y'all my children, y'all bit my shit and contracted rabies
Don't you grade me next to these rappers baby, that's degrading
My style got so many different facets
I switch into so many different passions, I'm skippin class to be fascinating
My pen is like Big Ben, this shit just a classic waiting
Your favorite rapper come at me, I'll just decapitate him
Out here congratulatin these has beens who had they highs
These rappers only won they matches because they strategize
I'll bring Attica to these patterns and here's my battle cry

Ring the alarm
The caterpillar is firing, ohhh
We in a war
Where butterflies keep dying, ahhh hey

This right here for the number one
Number one shit with your number one
You ain't number one, just another one
Now e'rybody sayin that they number one
Kid think your number won't quit
Number one song, get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When it's all done then your number gon' switch

Royce Da 5'9
Hold up, wait a minute
Guess what I'ma never do Show so much respect to you
That I feel like we're friends so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone who's not as smart as you, gas you up and tell you somethin you never knew
Always stay professional, you always gon' make revenue
Don't let people next to you, that don't want the best for you
It's completely normal to hold onto a regret or two
I do what I wanna do, they do what I let them do
Everything these niggaz be sayin is a fuckin lie
It's nothin I can say to you that is realer
Remember when you praisin the butterfly
Don't you ever disrespect the fuckin caterpillar

Eminem   Royce Da 5'9
You're lookin at Attila, the psychopathic killer, the caterpillar
Don't tell me when I'm supposed to rap until e 
specially when your favorite rapper ain't even half as ill, a
savage still, the track's a banana peel, attack of the silverback gorilla
You're havin a little trouble fathomin
this is actually happenin like Anderson Silva back when he
snapped his shin in half and then had the shit hangin by a flap of skin
after he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again
Pad to pen I'm batty like eyelids when they're blinkin a lot
You copy me but you're not
You can't be butterflies, my offsprings are just moths
I see that thing I'ma squash it and rip the wings of it off
So ring the alarm, pull the extinguishers off
the walls, set the sprinklers off
Like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah 'til the shingles come off
the roof, we'll shout at the ceiling, Slaughterhouse in the building, middle fingers a loft
Say what I think when I rhyme
In ink pen I talk and the language I speak is my mind, Kingpin and Penguin combined
Spit like it's King of the Dot, a singular thought
I think of will help you distinguish apart the frauds from the cream of the crop
Wait a minute, hold up Like a flashcard, damn dawg
Is that copyin or payin homage
It's sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler
My dad is your grandfather, I'll have to re hatch on ya
Come back as a black wasp, half yellow jacket you can't swat, a
Sasquatch dancin on top of an ant
Trample it and stomp it, smash it and stand on it
Damnit I can't stop it
The rap is a vag' and I'm goin in like a tampon in this bitch, it's a manslaughter
Stampin out grasshoppers, you can't be no  Rap Gods 
In fact you're exact opposites, you make a wack song/wax on
And can't hold a candle but even Daniel san wax/whacks off
You jack offs, need to cum/come to grips like a handjob
... The boom bap is comin back
with an axe to mumble rap; lumberjack with a hacksaw
Number one, but my pencils are number twos
Cause that's all I do's with 'em, poop is my pseudonym
On the john like a prostitute when I'm droppin a deuce and when I'm producin
them lyrical bowel movements these beats are like my saloons
Cause these bars always got my stools in 'em
And I don't need Metamucil to loosen 'em
Bitch, shit  Is real  like I pooped Jerusalem
I'm 'bout to go spin another cocoon then I'm cuttin you from your mother's womb
then I'm flushin you

Eminem
I am bored
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm rippin your wallet off 
and slippin a Molotov in your Cocktail take that
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
I'm on some shook shit, if it's missin I took it whoops
Nurse look at this straightjacket, it's crooked
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail FedEx
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head 
when the rest of his body's still alive RUNNIN

Royce
Comin with five gunmen, waitin to do a drive by
So when you see the black 500 what hide from it
For every hundred MC's rhymin about birds
only about two thirds'd really set it without words
Yo you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's rainin slugs what
I'm the hottest shit in the industry uh
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up what
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leakin blood and spittin phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible

Eminem
it takes six minutes to get applause yay
And by the time you all catch on, I'ma end your career 
and walk away with the whole floor so you have nothin to fall back on
Pull a fuckin headache outta my head, and put it in yours take this
I'm indoors, waitin for this acid to seep in my skin pores
to go outdoors and do some in stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, It oughta happen.
You swallow cum bitch   No, but I brought a napkin
Gettin skullie while I'm autographin
Got my daughter laughin cause I sent her mother whitewater raftin
I'm not a fact, I'ma proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my U haul screamin, 
Wait, wait, wait.. you ain't movin here
Lorena Bobbitt, c'mere, want a souveneir
I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi neer
Juvenile  Same difference    I need some 'caine 
cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
Oh my God Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'

Royce
Walkin in swamp water with an M 16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places what
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icin my fame, blowin your hand off
Dancin with the Devil leadin   I won't die, I'm never leavin what
I pledge allegiance to forever breathin
Street niggaz with nuts, what  My meat's bigger what
Fake ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
with a deathwish, thinkin I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil what
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for

EmThe Bad.. the Evil..
The Bad.. the Evil..

Uh, oh yeah
Uh, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah

See I done said so much   so much
I done said so much that I ain't even got that much to say
I done cried so much   so much
I done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away   quiet
That's how it be when you come up around gangsters Quiet
Silence be the same color my chain is Quiet
That's how it be comin up on my block Quiet
Silence be the same color my watch Quiet

Royce Da 5'9
Hold up, shhh, keep your mouth shut
Them street sweepers'll come through and clean your house up
Us Detroit niggaz call that yellow tapin the scene
My South niggaz call it chalked up
You know we put money on it when it's real
They call me Mr. Fifty a Head, I'm sendin ten niggaz to kill ya at ten until
Every man got an expiration date, and a price
All my revolvers got the spinnin  Wheel 
I make the Lord you pray to appear tonight like Vanna White
Them racketeerin charges startin to look like a tennis deal
I call the garden in my back yard Garden of Weeden
lookin like some spinach spiel   but still I'm dealin raw
From sellin to buyin weed, actually I'm stealin all
I'm the last of a dyin breed that I'm out here killin off
Four of my closest friends don't know their papas
so I pull out rows of dollars to show 'em these real forefathers peelin off
Get money

Tiara
Hold up, shhh, I should've been born deaf mute
Talkin gets you stripped naked
Shootin at your feet dancin 'til Chip and Dale's at your  Rescue

Look, time is money, I'm on EST
Keep playin, light up your block like Christmas E V E
I'm the  New Edition  of  Poison , BBD
For that bread my niggaz'll stamp you, EBT
I let a hot line sting 'em, you in the cop's line singin
Ever since you left the city now they  Hotline's Blingin 
Hmm, seen a paddy wagon cruisin and I'm deducin
that they are only movin cause all the rumors that you in
If I had to draw a conclusion all the gangsters we losin
is because of the illusion, you are not in collusion
with the boys that's wearin blue and it's causin all this confusion
And they wouldn't even know but y'all tellin what niggaz doin

Royce Da 5'9
I'm goin on an AK a thon
Throw a Bible at some shallow waters right before I go and pray upon
Double parked, custom license plates says I can pay a fine
I ain't in the zone, I'm in the motherfuckin lay up line
Speakin of lay ups, we do homi's based on how we doin
Last lay up line I was in was a body viewin
I'm preoccupied with the Earth's ills
Good herbals, first meal was milk, I milk these niggaz for my first mil'
Full circle, off of just talkin I could tell types
But I'll still give that bitch my whip test
If she not exhausted then she can easily tailpipe
Playin that dirty hand I was dealt, don't complain to me nigga, tell Christ
I'm standin over coffins with hammers and screws, with a sickness
Man a cure/Manicure wouldn't hand a nigga these nails right
Only hand me down I had was inherited head lice
But nothing's more bugged out as my head size, I live twice
E'ry day, one for the body of Martin Luther King, I'm dead nice
Rest call me Malcolm, they want me dead because I'm dead right
Ask me to spell die, I'ma accidentally spell dice
I can shelve a label with my shelf life
I'm a rider but still I steal bikes
Out of the field terrorizin reptiles and field mice
I'm cut, like I'm touched, a blind man with Braille spikes
I'm deep, I could break up a motherfuckin whale fight
Get money

Became sick in the brain since Bugz's death
Whoever did it, I'm a bust a nose, slugs is left
I'm harder than my dick when I'm watchin my first porn
Ill enough to kill your wife while she's havin her first born
Leavin the hospital, in a voice just like Beavis
Screamin I need some while I'm holding up a fetus
Spittin the hot shit, nick name is godzilla ugggh
Natural born, undercover cop killa

If you didn't want this muthafuckin rap game twisted
You should have never let Detroit listed muthafucka

Ed Sheeran
Yeah I was born a misfit, grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
Stick to singing, stop rappin like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin money then my conversation's shiftin
My dreams are bigger than just being on the rich list
Might be insanity but people call it gifted
My face is goin numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a, private guy, yeah you know nothin 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna, crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's, 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna, crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's, 'bout time you remember the name
Heyyy, ayy hey, hey, hey

Eminem
I can still remember what tryna shop a deal uh huh
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it yeah became an addict, funny, cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell what if I'd prevail huh
And all I did was what put nine inch nails where
In my eyelids now what
I'm seein diamond sales, like I'm in Zales yeah
Without a doubt by any means, if rap was skinny jeans I couldn't do anything
in 'em, I'd be splitting seams of denim, when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no if ands or butts are squeezin in between
You sleep on me, cause you're only fuckin with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed, man I feel like Ed
It isn't time to drop the mic yet, so why would I quit
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead, just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

It isn't, my time to call it a day
I got, rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's, 'bout time you remember the name
Heyyy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got, rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's, 'bout time you remember the name
Heyyy, ayy

50 Cent
Ain't nobody cold as me
I dress so fresh, so clean
You could find me in my whip rockin my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin, wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemi's with locks on it
Anything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin
It's just another episode, my hoes I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit, and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin stupid money; what else we gon' do with money
Bitch, we be ballin out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout the shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit

Tomorrow we hangin over, 'til we start feelin sober
Then it's time to start it over
Here we go again

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got, rap locked and I'm already paid
This is, 'bout time you remember the name
Heyyy, ayy

And there's only one thing that I want from you

C'mon let me ride your bicycle

If you get a bee sting
I can suck out all the poison
I can make you laaaaast
Like other bitches caaaaan't
Have I made it clear, boy
There's only one thing that I want from you, HEY

Skylar Grey
I'm only fucking with you
Fuck you for thinking it's true
I'm not like the sluts in this town
They make me BLECH in my mouth
I wanna ride on your bike
Cause you're the boy that I like
It's like I'm a sell out for you
But your bike's so shiny and new shiny and new

Eminem   Skylar
She's distracted, by my reflectors, man I can this chick's attracted
My wheels SPOKE to her, my Schwinn is a chick magnet
Baggin up chicks like a bag of chips
with a bag of prophylactics as big as Mick Jagger lips
Shaggin's, somethin I'm a pro at, but I ain't practicin shit
Flip backwards while I flip this bike on its banana seat
My fantasy's to have you land where the kickstand is
Got this bitch gaggin, they call me the broad killer
I'm the cousin of Godzilla
Cause I spit fire and my dick's draggin/dragon
Zig zaggin up the avenue pullin these chicks in my antagonist, wagon
Screamin

You want to ride my bicycle
You want to ride my bike
You want to ride my bicycle
You want to ride my bike
Haha

You could make me a believer, oh
Even if that shit ain't true, oh, oh
You could make me com mit murder
Baby I'd kill for you

Skylar Grey
In my eyes
Even if you are wrong, you are right
Even if it's a terrible crime, it's alright
Cause I got your back, and I know you got mine
I belong I belong
to the church of your name, sing a song sing a song
Cause I worship the ground you walk on you walk on
If I pray for you, I know you'll be therrrrrrre

Skylar Grey
In my bed
I believe every word that you've said
Just a kiss and you make me forget, all the bad
The battles we've lost, the bodies we hid
You don't know you don't know
just how far I'd be willing to go to go
You put the cracks into my moral code moral code
So you can count on me, to always be therrrrrrre

Skylar Grey
Oh Lord, forgive my weary hands
And for what they may do
I'll carry out his evil plans
If he wants me to

Eminem
In your dream, you're drownin, I just waltz in and save you
I'm your alternate escape route, the altar you pray to
Your ultimate savior   your behavior is altered
Ain't your fault cause I made you, brainwash and persuade you
Gibraltar, your faith'll, never falter or waver
One you call to in danger, I'm your guardian angel
Nobody can tell you, shit you've already made your
mind, just follow me babe you, won't be sorry you stayed, you
always ride, whatever the plan is
'Til the end, even if I led us into an ambush
Even if we robbed a First National
And cops caught us red handed
they're comin at us and we're trapped with our backs up
against the wall and it's too tall, you'd catapult me
or hold the ladder for me, stay back to get captured
Take the fall, you make it all worth it, baby doll
You're perfect, the way you are   accidents happen
All I know is you love me, that's really all that matters
And any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
At your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal
Backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals
When they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction
You'll lay a bitch flat on her back in
a second flat for me
Who tries to take your man from you, it's blasphemy, another casualty
You'll go whatever route
Do whatever you have to do, you'd blast for me, I never doubt   that

Eminem
Yea yea, yo, yo
This just in

The lunatics now run the asylum
The doctors are dead, nurses are tied up
They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum
I said the lunatics now run the asylum
The doctors are dead, nurses are tied up
They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum

Joell Ortiz
I walk around with O.J.'s glove knowin it fit
Fifth to the toilet, we takin over this shit
The Yaowa waited, salivated like Man I know I can spit
I was knockin for quite some time but y'all wouldn't open this bitch
You turn green when I enter, probably can't breathe
Now y'all trees in the winter, nobody can't leave
For all those that was doubtful I got a scalpel
and a mouth full of vowels that make a party stampede
You brag about swag and your feminine trends
I belittle your riddle, you Skittles with  Eminem's  friends
So I ain't tryin to play wit'chu
This chainsaw crack jokes on Cain's brother brah, diss Abel you
Vroom I'm an untamable animal
with aim from a movin train, I can graze your decayin tooth
And my strait jacket just came unloose
So I'm reportin live, this is breaking news

Crooked I
Psycho like no bitch made nigga
So this great nigga go insane
I got the switchblade to your throat, move it's not smart
I'll slice and watch you bleed all over the pop charts
Me and the Slaughters run the asylum
I'm feelin like DiCaprio rappin on  Shutter Island 
This industry is pussy, guess who gon' hit it the meanest
Give her the penis, hit the bitch in her Venus
To this game I'm addicted and fiendish
I'm predicted to bring this G shit, to it's pinnacle zenith
Lyrical genius, so sick with ridiculous English
Niggaz get squeamish when they hear this criminal linguist
Ah, fall back it's the takeover
Y'all wack and your cake over
I escaped from the padded room
Grab a broom, rape a male rapper's womb

Royce Da 5'9
I'm one as the worst happenin, the hurt moment when I'm purse snatchin
On purp' goin berserk bonin miss Nurse Ratchet
When we spit you get the pug face
Your bitch swallowed my $5 foot long on a  Subway 
If sane people are rich, why should I sit around
Play me and end up like the back of this hospital gown
Ass out   drink drink drink drink
Pass out   y'all feel me, right
When I was young I was loud, I used to be like I'LL KILL YA
Now I be like, You know I'll kill you, right
If y'all don't like it y'all can lick my dick
Cause we built this house we live in brick by brick

Eminem   Royce
I wanna be the best who ever did it
Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't
But if it is then God if you're listenin
Please give me the strength to crush all competition
You can't blame me for dreamin, I'm a dreamer
And if I'm comin off brash please forgive me
But, that's all I want I just wanna be the illest MC
That's all I want the same time bein as real as can be

Royce Da 5'9
Mayhem, sickness, murder, horror
These are the kind of words that describe my aura
G. Rap, Ras Kass, Kurupt, Redman
I am cut from that cloth, write a rhyme about me, you a dead man
Cool J, I'm Bad video
Learned the whole routine and performed it for my father's friends
while they smoked and drink, symphony, D.O.C.
Inspired me to write what, would eventually put me on  Airplanes  like B.o.B
Canibus, Wu Tang, you know our history but hats off
When we rap as Jack Frost we outline the track chalk
Thank GOD for the one two cadence
Thank GOD for the lunchroom tables
I'm tryin to be the sickest nigga dead or alive
And if I happen to fall short it's been one hell of a ride
Chronic 1 and 2
Lookin up at the sky at the sun, up until the day the sun is you
You're listenin to hip hop
You in Jay house, Wayne house, Nas house, Em house our house

So welcome, to our house
Where no one, comes back out
You might find, comfort
In here, in here, in here

Joell Ortiz
When I was a lil' boy I wanted to be a rapper
Wanted to be on the radio and snappin pictures after
And so I grabbed my pen and pad and scribbled chitter chatter
It started off wack, but in the words of a 10 year old my shit was gettin phatter
I hit the studio at 16, stupid ill
Not knowin how the booth would feel, what's a DATs and 2 inch reels
But I sure enough learned the ropes, look D and Mike, y'all made a monster
Now every day's a game of  Contra , I got 99 men
An infinite amount of rounds inside this mighty fine pen
This is my dream, don't fuck with it, I'm tellin you
Cause anyone can get dusted long as production is available
I'm disgusted as a fan, look how niggaz soundin, DAMN
Weak head, y'all suck bad, fuck swag and your kicks from South Japan
I'm finna be the best in this profession
I've been invested all my life so wipe your feet before you step in our house

Eminem   Joe Budden
I wanna be the best who ever did it
Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't
But if it is then God if you're listenin
Please give me the strength to crush all competition
You can't blame me for dreamin, I'm a dreamer
And if I'm comin off brash please forgive me
But, that's all I want I just wan' be the illest MC
That's all I want same time bein as real as can be

Crooked I
Yo, in my house the lights out, no utilities in this facility
Feelin my life's 'bout, to wipe out, these feelings I'm feelin be killin me
I pull a mic out, can't strike out, cause if winnin is really my enemy
I'll pull a 9 out, blow my mind out, is the end of me really serenity
Man in my house, it's rap or die, get a piece of that apple pie
Life is a Pharcyde song, and that bitch just  Passes By 
So I, got lyrically complex, that way I could fly jets
Get my moms out the projects, with these concepts, competition can't digest
And then I stress cause the road is ROUGH, I start feelin like shit's sour
The electricity in my willpower, can still power, the Twin Towers
for ten hours, so send cowards
the message from Crooked I, Royce Da 5, Joe Budden, Em, Yaowa

Eminem
In our, house we spittin like six hours, the way I feel now I can spit for six hours
straight, only way to be great, is to dig down, if you can hear this sound in 
side my head sounds like a fuckin drive by, that's what the inside of my mind's like
Lookin back on, my career even, hindsight's, tunnel vision, 5 Mics
Never wanted that so bad, feel like I could go mad, nomad with a notepad
Go Taz, spaz on these hoe bags that bother me but I never wanna show that
Just don't act like it ever does, even though you know that there will never come
a day someone blows past you who never was, someone who's as dope as you ever was
And you hope that's, true cause the competitor in you couldn't let somebody be better than you
And you know that, so you don't ever hold back, what you gonna go back, to workin a regular job
Fuck that, I'ma go hard grab on my, gonads   tell 'em fuck theyself
They call me a wigger/'weger like Renee Zell' but I, raised hell like a stay at home dad
Rap is the only thing that I was ever really, bad to the bone at
Guess I'm similar to, Gang Green when I'm, angry then I'm, Hulk Smash
So much passion but no compassion, if eyes are the window to the soul
then it's, broken glass and there's no trespassin, aight now here we go
Dre stamped me now I'm stampin Yelawolf, be ready for the most competitive
clique in the world, it's like Clash of the Titans, I release the cracker, it's time to set it again
And when it's said and it's all done none shall ever fuck with the squadron
So come on in at your own risk; this is our house bitch

Right about now, you're about to be possessed
by the sounds, of Slaughterhouse yeah

Cause she strips, to get tips
Those lips and those child bearing hips
I'll throw this, I'll throw this dick on you girl, girl
I'll throw this, I'll throw this dick on you girl, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building 'til I make you spill drinks
Girl this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding a lings

Upside down I'll throw this grip on you girl

Crooked I

Joell Ortiz

Yo, yo
What if I was white skin the same color as cocaine
Blond hair, blue eyes, the whole shibang
I know one thing; police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me 
Can I get your autograph
The yellow cabs in the city would stop for me
I wouldn't need collateral to buy property
If I was white, wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
SECURITY wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something Maybe he might of stole something
Because I'm black I rob and automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white I wouldn't of thought O.J. was innocent He did it

If I was white
What if he was white
What if he was white Yo think about that
What if he was white, white,  white, white, he was white for a minute

Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, preppy or high class
YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A TRAILERPARK AND BE WHITE TRASH
In any case that be the ill shit right Yep
But there's a good and bad side of being white
You can't say the N word without startin a fight What's up my nigger
Couldn't dance to a beat, I'd have two left feet
Even if I was white plaque still have a ghetto shit How you doing
Is it a myth or do I really have a little dick Nah, it's true
If I was white, I would probably listen to hard rock
and cover my ears when ever I heard Hip Hop Ahhhhhhhhhhhh

What if he was white

Yo, yo, yo, if I was white
I probably wouldn't even think the same
I'd watch Tennis and Golf and bet on Hockey games Red Wings Man
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
And there probably would of never even been an Onyx, shit
I be serice sippin vodka and tonix
Smokin on a marlboro instead of a Newport
Id live in Long Island instead of New York
If I was white, I probably couldn't dunk
cuz everybody knows white man can't jump Nope
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the weed spot
Cuz all of the dreads would think I'm a cop

If he was white
What if he was white

Pharoahe Monch, The RZA, Tech N9NE, Xzibit

King Tech
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the hip hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the WOOORRRLLD FAMOUS Wake Up Show

RZA
Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue twist piercin holes in you 
You can't escape seventy thousand kilowatts blast through yo' box
Walk wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M 80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP Tech is on

Tech N9NE
When I Woke Up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is comin lookin around your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the Midwest, leavin MC's litless
On the Wake Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake up flow
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha schizo
Hypno, chryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yellin Tech N9NE svelte

Eminem
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white out
Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows where you at
Climbed out of a nice house
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
Hey that's my couch bitch
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin verticle
nose first wit the top off landin up side down
You're tied down and duct taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

Xzibit
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, lock loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cuz your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake Up
The X Man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game huntin from high noon till the full moon

Pharoahe Monch
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Korloff was
When I cut ya neck, leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off
Hauled off, sawed off shotgun blast
He asked, why did he have to die like cast metal
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution 
On the Wake Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

Kool G Rap
I sway the tec wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the head decay
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit blood redecorate
Until the head of jake investigate

Jayo Felony
What, Sway can give it to but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
Tech  can give it to you but Whatcha Gon' Do
Rev can give it to you but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What

Chino XL
Yo yo, Chino make the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style foul/file, for sexual harrassment like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg, your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show reppin, wit Sway & Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

KRS One
De de de da de de de da di day HEY KRS One comin wit the Tech & Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway and a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back but for now just SACKLE
Ha ha ha, FRESH for 1999 you SUCKAS

Eminem
Peace to Thirstin Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerd cursed, wit badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first
Ninety nine percent of aliens prefer earth
So I'm here to rule the planet, startin wit your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a wordsearch
Wit smeard letters, runnin together in blurred spurts
I hang wit male chauvinist pigs and perverts
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerber's
My first words were Bleep bleep and Curse curse
Never had ish, and I still don't deserve dirt
My breath still stinks and I'm on my third Certs
Yankin out my stitches, hollering Nurse nurse
You said this shot would numb it, trick it just hurts worse
Grew up in a dump next door to a burnt church
But gunshots drowned out crickets and bird chirps
And it's like that, and it's like that

Evidence
Got no apathy
Yo I Platform my strategy, mix words in alchemy
Evidence, I won't get caught shot on the balcony
Between you and I, I'll tell you here's the diff
Gun to your head, you're dead, pointblank I shapeshift
That's right, to dear/deer, anelope, or owl
In life, use your potential, or Steve Howe
I'm about to call it quits, yo too much weight'll break your rack mount
The man'll make you move, yo so make your move a backout
You say I use my name too much as a clutch
Try holdin on to beat instead of pushin on your crutch
Flipped it backwards, Evidence attack nerds off the head
Steadfast, right or left, don't matter see you comin 
Deaf/Def like Leppards, pop the piece,  I be the sheppard
Causin the herd, the name is Ev absurd
Verbs get flipped, it's like this, yo acronyms and all that
Methaphor imagery, you claimin metaphors and spittin similies
Not havin It, the name is Evidence
Like Pos. K gibbin the life thinkin of stabbin it
Skills prevail you possess, take no offense
But don't profess lies within your mind, tempt and stress

Iriscience
It's like uh oh oh
It's Dilated Peoples on the Wake Up Show uh oh
We kick a lick or some for the radio uh oh

Eminem
Yo, I'll shove a gun in ya grill, greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated
While you breathin' you'll be leavin'
The receiving room this evening with Jesus
You hate on us, we'll be waitin' on eight corners
Swarmin' ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders
I'll hop in the Jeep, slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that ya mom bought you
Mess around and get choked and found in a moat
Floatin' around drowned face down in a boat
I'll pile five dudes in a pen
And we'll pull up to the seven mile drive thru
At McDonald's and pile drive you
I got the power to snatch a driver out his Eddie Bauer
When it rides by me at ninety miler per hour
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows
It's like that, it's like that

Met a retarted kid named Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44 D
Forget an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead
No more said case closed end of discussion
We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas
Cross the bombest
We blowing up your house
Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas
I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nastradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive bys in tinted Corvettes
On Vietnam war vets
I am more or less sick in the head
Maybe more 
Because I smoked crack  today, yesterday,
and the day before Sabateur
Walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more straps than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure

Eminem Sway & King Tech
It's like that Uh, Eminem...Eminem
Alright bust it What

Eminem
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got chu' locked in a cellar with your skeleton showin'
Developin' anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya
Eatin' a four course meal watchin' you starve to death
Put a IV in ya vein feedin' ya liquid Darvaset
Pumpin' you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on a gunshot victim full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up by an ambulance and driven to receiving
With they asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than twenty percent chance of livin'
Havin' a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storin' the dead bodies in grandma's lil' basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy
On you while you scream I'm still alive
Drivin' a rusty scalpel through the top of ya scalp
I'm pullin' ya Adam's apple out through ya mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arsonist
To set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartment

Mic check.. My dick
Ffff fuck.. My dick  My nuts..

My attitude is worse than NWA's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people 
who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does My tattoo
You see me standin outside of your buildin; screamin, 
Puffy is good, HEY but Slim Shady is for the children WAIT
I look at my life in a new light    fuck it
Give me two mics; I write songs for me    fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half hearted; cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryin to get my porno career started
Every place and event..  Been There, Done That 
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went 
Want a deal  Study these 5 chapters
Lesson One: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson Two: Face em and diss em whattup dog
Don't give em a demo; kidnap em I want you to come with me
and make em come to your basement and listen 
you're gonna fuckin check this out
Lesson Three: Get a job at a label; switch demos with Canibus 
and put yours on the owner's table here listen
Lesson Four: 'Know you heard this before'
Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure
Don't act like a fan    you wanna get signed
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson Five: Get a hook up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street; I ain't 
givin you shit bitch   don't even bother askin me get away from me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin
cause I'm always shittin when I'm rappin like Master P UNNNGGGGH
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
my balls broke both of her collarbones OWW
Told Mya this shit was all about me ah It's all about me..
Gave Alyssa Milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea You're a dick
And all three of my main girls said SEE YA
Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin Aaliyah
What  Oh my God  I splish splash while I'm takin a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash    fuckin your wife in the ass Oh  Ooh Shady  Oooh
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass

So if I hurt your self esteem 
and you get dissed too bad Yo why you diss me
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had A big dick
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad Nurse Nurse
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad

What a wonderful day; I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renee Oh hi I was just about to toss a live grenade
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh MOOOOO
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with  Agent Orange 
And wiped my ass with his page in Source Here
The demon is here, steamin this year
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image I live it
Give a fuck  I don't know what a fuck is to give it
Yeah I don't think this guy is well..  I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail

I'll fuckin, I'll fuckin
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that

You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Chris topher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat 
while your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh eating disease
I'm iller than takin a hammer and beatin your knees
and walkin through South Central L.A., bleedin in jeans
Am I a Blood or a Crip  Wakin up the next day in breathin machines
Flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
on how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke

So if I hurt your self esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad

I know that makes you real mad, don't it  uh huh
That's right, Slim Shady  yup  Sway & Tech
Sprayin wreck  bitch

Today my wife left, I don't give a fuck
Bitch thats why I'm paying you 150 bucks how much for me and my man
to suck, me and Kuniva, let this diabetic dick touch your saliva
I think I'm gone and crazy, 14 to 48
Ever since we've fucked

Skank ho, trying to creep

You fucking freak trying to get the best of me
Kidnap your ass

You skank trick, you suck dick
Jason Williams what up

Kuniva
This devilist bitch is so succulent
Taking a piece of my soul every time
that I bust a nutt she's like a succubus
A nymphomanic laying me back on the filthy mattress
cum stains on it smelling like catfish
Still I hit it, yeah I did it
Her pussy travels
she doesn't have a pivot I remember when she was timid
Your scandalous ass taking a pass this cash
Got him on tape suckin your tit snortin and passing hash
I still had to grab that ass
Had to laugh at stories about your ragged ass maxi pads
You silly bitch, she used to be a nerdy bitch
Now she's in the backyard fucking 30 kids

Kon Artis
Now besides being on X, and regardless me loving sex
We getting close to you lex, its grindin every kick
Fingers up your pussy, your hands rubbing my dick
As soon as my wife push me
Your man's fucking her trick
You don't care if she know I trip
But she's starting to get  to it
Cuz She's finding matches in my pockets that say I strip
Which means I might get caught
loose everything that I've brought
The house the kids and the car
I know this sounds bizarre
but we should give her a call
and see if she want in
That way its 3 way sex and we can all be friends
I know you done if before
don't act like you haven't whore
I'm about to loose my wife I can't afford a divorce

Swift
Fucking with your pussy is a handful for real
You think I'm drowning but I'm clowing
so basically bitch you a damn fool
And thats a given fact
plus I remember back when you was young
I could see 100 niggaz through your gap
And all of them was probably hitting that, thats embarrassing
You stuck with 30 children, 70 miscarrages
In and out of buildings, ain't carin' who it is
Fucking newly weds, didn't mean to do it but you did

Proof
Devil is she, she never to be faithful
Credit to free its better that she tranquil
Even her apple
my cock unlock the keys to your asshole
Stop the plot through the freeze with my cash flow
Cock the glock at them  in the castle
Fresh out of school with a disease in the tassel
Skis in the satchel
You just my ho thats the reason you stack dough

You know I heard Harlem is back

Lil Jon
Let's Go

Come on
I said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
Come on

Ma$e
Yo yo yo yo its deja vu
And the day ya'll do
It'll be the day ya'll bleed
Wrist minus 80 degrees
King of Harlem ain't nobody made me leave
Who else could take 5 years off
Cold turkey come back and fly lears off
Cats front leave them leaning like Smirnoff
If haters wanna hate then its their loss
Come up in the Rucker with all my Jake's on
Car grills so big you can cook a steak on
People hear Ma$e call em' wanna get their mase on
You hot 16 I'm a very great song
Been beating on the DJ before the Ma$e song
You play Clake Kent you better have your cake on
Plenty homes Mansion many rooms
My necklace, 2 ex's and 3 Bentley bulls now lean back

Said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
Come on

Eminem
You don't want no problems with Harlem
You don't want no problems with the boogie down Bronkster
You don't want no drama with the blond bomber
Original don dotta of the blond bottle
The model from white America
Then Joe the spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Ma$e back to represent everything else in between including the
percentages of the press we don't
The best from each coast
The midwest to the dirty dirty
Even further to Miami
All the way back to Californ i a
It would probably be best right now if I warned Dre to get on the horn and
tell him about the storm coming all our way
So tell him pack grab a gat right now get on the floor I'll wait
Shake that ass a little more my way
But baby I don't dance not that I can't there's a pistol in my pants

Said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
Come on

Fat Joe
No Judas or cowardice that Caine's brother Abel is able to stop me
Nigga not me
Got the streets asking damn who can top P
Summer jam killed it man they did it all with 1 beat
I guess I'm bicoastal now
Took a down south brother to bring your boy out
As the wheel keeps spinning
I can hear Niggars thinking Crack got one hit then he out
No Joey bring them semi's out
Force you and yours to pour a little Henny out
So much rappers acting in the game
I had to tell them put the mic away and run and get your Emmy's out
Lean back mother fucker
This here's a three peat we back at the Rucker
It's good coke crack preach it to your brother
The mic more rap and preach you mother fucker

Said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
Come on

Lil Jon
Said my niggaz don't dance we just pull out a gat
And say blow your block away, fuck nigga lean back, lean back, lean back
lean back
I Said my niggaz don't dance we just pull out a gat
And say blow your block away, bitch nigga lean back, lean back, lean back
lean back
Hey

Thirstin Howl III
I hit harder, than Foreman, landing both gloves to a low blow, with no cup
Leave you  Speech  less like when Arrested Development broke up
Carry a crowbar for egos that won't budge
Crack skulls, through helmets, with the penetration, of a screw, nailed in
Return like I was sending self addressed postage
Throw bricks, the size of the Stonehenge
Before battles, we pour blood and toast death
to wicked infants, found on the sorceress' doorsteps
Slaughter lamb, and boar's head
Every MC's cause of boredness and mind bondage
Bronchitis, lung failure, language unfamil iar
Art through a flooded airbrush
Rogue leaf craft, sentences joined with words holding hands
It's a tight squeeze, from where your head will be landing
In exact time, flight leaves

...

Eminem
Who's arm is this Huh I must have cut it off at the pharmacist
that refused to renew my 7th presciption of Darvocet sorry
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
That never leaves his house, cause he thinks his car's possessed
I hate my life, that's why I degrade my wife
Srabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich, and just ate the knife
My mother's screamin, Please heal him, take him straight to Christ
Meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice whattup
I made a bomb threat with a fake device
Strip you naked twice, pistolwhip you and force you to take advice
And if you catch me bobbin my head to some bullshit you was spittin
I was probably just tryin to shake the lice brrrrrrr
Bugs fallin out of my head, I'm wishin I was dead
While I'm crawlin out of my bed, piss and vomit red
And my rash is returning, I feel the sensation of burning
Occurin usually during painful release of my urine
Screamin at my shadow, Please quit followin me
These pills keep screamin, Please quit swallowin me
The devil keeps screamin, Please get down on one knee
I took the drugs before the cops ever found 'em on me

Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote
The streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin new, I seen it all befo'
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote

All she wrote, all she wrote
I said it's over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote

T.I.
Yeah, ay
It's stupid how I go in knowin everybody knowin
that I'm sewin up the game, destroyin life, they hate me for it
Eventually see they can't beat then with me they join
Others sworn under oath or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get cut, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On a fast track, ain't no need for no pit stop
I just laugh at, nigga wishin they was this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on; I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high steppin primetime
Thought you niggaz been known, ain't no blockin my shine
Like my new Air Yeezy's you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin life, you check to check recitin rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind, mind, mind

Eminem
You're starin straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed, wait, Sarah you're late
Your train left, mascara and egg smear on your face
Night's over, goodbye hoe, I thought that I told ya
that spilled nut ain't nothin to cry over
Never shoulda came within  Range  of my Rover
Should known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
She still come back to the crib, must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller when I won't even buy her soda
Unless it's Rock & Rye cola Satan's cheaper
Buy you a bag of Fritos I wouldn't let you eat the fuckin chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye/die for ya
Tryin to pull five bucks from me is like tryin to pull five molars
You get your eyes swole up, I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch You're already bi polar

Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
I don't ever know where I'm finna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

T.I.
The credit rollin, curtain closin, movie over with that's it
But don't get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Your life is sure a bitch, but she know I'm rich I'm rich
That's why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, dividend got it pourin in
Peso, euro, yen   ah ha I'm paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in, anythang, wearin any chain
Never gon' see me totin anythang, all you gon' see is BANG
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level but you niggaz still can get it
It's all over 'fore you finished, sorry bro this where we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business

Eminem
Yeah I guess life is a bitch, ain't it Tip And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my hankerchief
I'm givin these hoes a dose of they own medicine, let 'em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now but in case you didn't
This shit's so bad better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin it; double timin it
but I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
to catch on, while you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K Mart's like there's an apostrophe S on it dawg
And they say McDonald's isn't a restaurant, well I guess I'm wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the F on dawg

T.I.
Ha ha ha, and on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I'm as strong as they came, they were gone 'fore they came
Now I don't wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty that's why, why, why

Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote
I roll like a desperado
And I don't ever know where I'm gonna go

Eminem
Man Tip told me on this hoe tip, best tip I can give you 
to hip you is never to let these tricks trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love you slut, shit
Dig a hole, take this shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns like double stick, it's you
But fuck it Tip, it's cool   I'm chillin like a villain
like The Penguin in his fuckin igloo eatin fudgescicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love wit'chu
'Fore I tie a fuckin knot I'd tie you in one, bitch you
think this is some Nintendo game, how fuckin dumb is you
I'll give you some lumps, 'fore I split some lump sums wit'chu
So here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger
But a nickel might just get you one pickle
Fuck it it's official so blow the whistle
I got a trust issue, there's a bombshell, SCUD missile
Like I just cuss at you to fuckin cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was a motherfuckin stud, slut this'll
teach you not to come drunk stumblin my way, for shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slots check stub bizzle
So fuck Sizzlers, these checkers'll bust like a BLOOD blister

Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know soon as they saw me

E When we touch down

T In the midwest we okay
E'rybody know them southern boys love that bass
E Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, 'weesiana
Mississippi, Ten a keys, every mufuckin state, when we touch down
T Go right from the plane to the rave
E When we touch down
T On a private plane getting brains, till we
E Touch down, there ain't no way to keep em quiet
With T.I. and Shady baby, we bout to incite a riot
When we touch down

When we get in town, you know how we getting down
Pull up clean, then hop on out, snatch all the freaks then walk on out
I'm living what they talking bout, shining if it dark or not
That one hundred E X double R, you'll find that in the parking lot
You barking up the wrong tree, I do this shit for zone three
Four, five and six as well as one, Atlanta I'm forever son
Still be on whatever coke, ridin' blowing heavy smoke
Ay Em you better tell them folk won't hesitate to let 'em go
They know I put that green light on them haters
Keep on trying me I put that beam right on ya tater pow
Now you don't wanna see T.I.P. outrageous
Try to keep him in a cage but somehow he keep escaping
That's why I be on vacation, Virgin Island I be taking
Private planes out to Spain, I keep on flying I ain't faking
The money ain't a thang, think I'm lying, you're mistaken
You can find long lines of all kinds of bitches waiting when we touch down

Welcome to the Midwest, yes
Where them Detroit playas ball like you have no idea
The boy is here, got the whole place looking like it's candy painted
Ain't it like we left the kids at home and just let em loose with the crayons
Fuck, I just hit a jogger, people looking like Frogger
They hopping out of the way whenever they see Marshall's car coming
The kids painted my windows with black permanent marker
And let the rest of the car carpet color like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumping but I'm bound to bump into something
Kids are flying through the air looking like they krumping
The way they tumbling, I gotta do something
But as soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off
They just right back at it tommorrow
They're like, Dad this is in, so you're with the trends
This is for the pimps, listening to mens, nail polish on the rims
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show
So go on with ya bad self, just have it back to normal when I touch down

From my arrival, un til my departure
Gurantee I put this d i c k in somebody's daughter
Ay, I still have my way with the ladies way cross the water
Flew to Paris from Haiti, did some shit that I thought of
It's erotic that the shit that we popping makes us psychotic
Threaten corporate America, that's why they running from me
How could they be so ignorant Look what hip hop done brung us
It's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys
Got us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here ain't no way you taking it from me
So excuse me Oprah honey, I'm sorry, really I promise
But niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just being honest
For that am I being punished Why is you so astonished
Now I ain't got a degree, just intelligence in abundance
So you ain't gotta like me, I know billions of folks who love me
You can tell how they yelling and screaming and waiting for me when I touch down

Eminem
If I'm elected for ten terms
I'm renewing the staff after the inagural
And hiring all girls as interns
If I don't like you, I'll snatch you outta your mic booth
While you're rappin and pull your right through the window and fight you
I'll take you straight to the pavement
Uppercut you, and scrape your face wit a bracelet
Like a razor that shaved it
Three drinks and I'm ready to flash
Runnin on stage in a G string, wit a bee sting on my ass Look
It's probably all cuz I ain't awkward at all
I just like to walk through the mall, stop, and talk to the wall
And have a relapse after I just fought through withdrawl
Hop in the car little girl, I just bought you a doll
The Bad and Evil movement is comin
Plus the music is pumpin like a pill freak wit a tube in his stomach
I write a rhyme a day
So it's no wonder how come your whole album 
Is soundin like a bunch of shit that I would say
I'll probably be the cleverest one that never gets spun ever
It's Slim Shady and Tony Touch, it's only us
The rest of y'all are just stuck in the middle wit Monie Love

Eminem
Get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back

You better get back, get back
You better...

Proof
Doin a box of doctrine, on stompin oxygen
wit fork to your optic lens
Hittin wit a sudden force
Leave your boy layin in the same puddle of blood as yours
When I flood his porch
Smuugle a gun in court and shoot the judge
Easily reduce a thug to a future scrub
A double deuce wit slugs, I'm Proof on drugs
We'll turn you to a rapper that we used to love
How you on medicine cabinet pills
Grabbin the steel, leapin over buildings that haven't been built
I'm not the best yet cuz I haven't been killed
I'm laughin at you faggot ass rappin for deals, you better

Eminem
Get back, get back
You better get back, get back back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back back
You better...

I'm disappointed in my dentist appointment
He only gave me the fuckin gas for thirty minutes this mornin
Went to the hospital to get a chest X ray
Checked out the next day in a dress wit a sex change
I'm havin a bad day
My fuckin dad's gay, I hate fags, and I'm fuckin mad cuz I don't have AIDS
All I want to do is die
I tried suicide six times and couldn't even do it right
Collapsed, had a relapse and called three cabs
And had to be dragged back to rehab wit bloody kneecaps
Enrolled myself in a twelve step program
Tripped on the first step and got pinned down in a chokeslam
I swear to God, this 'Pac poster comes any closer 
I'm kickin this whole fuckin wall over
Two more shots and it's all over
I'm all over this wall, tryin not to fall over

Bizarre
BLOAW BLOAW
Shots in broad day
BIZARRE, THAT'S YOUR MOM
The bitch shouldn't have been in the way
Me, Shady and Mike fuckin a hemaphrodite
My little sister was a virgin till late last night
High off a kite off of stick of sherm
Put your mother in a full nelson while my boys take turns
A unibomber tryin to escape this country
Tell O.J. he better be comin up wit my money
Bizarre goes commerical Nigga, you can forget it
I'm quick to smack the shit out of a foe
I ain't had pussy in a while, I'm too busy fuckin assholes
Battle me, you better go eat your vegetables
I'm iller than a Muslim eatin a pork hotdog in African festival
This shit is serious, watch me sniff 'cane
Avoid the pain and fuck a bitch barely potty trained

Eminem
Get back, get back
You better get back, get back back

You better get back, get back
You better get the FUCK back

Eminem
Yeah, y y yeah, y y y yeah, yeah

Don't ask me what's up with the hoes, I'm still workin the kinks out
Love stinks, that explains all this anger that's spillin out
And I ain't chillin out
Got an Oscar but I'm still a  Grouch 
I use it as a doorstop and a prop for the broken leg for the couch
Yelawolf, Shady, Tony, Touch, Slaughterhouse
Yeah the SWAT team 'bout to break them flyswatters out
Go to hell in a drought, break ice waters out
Nice try shorty wop, we can window shop, the jewelry store
But Christ for that price could've bought a house
Besides, only thing I ever had iced out
is my heart since I started out
It's F.Y.I. if ya ain't knowin
What Go with you where Nah, ain't goin
Oh wait, you want a date, oh well
In that case hoe it's June 8th, OH and
Kinda like Beethoven
composin a symphony of hate, so much hate woven
into these raps, he stitches a bitch, straight sewin
Shit I'm beginnin to hate clothing
I hate overalls cause they remind me of hoes
For Christ's sake, they're shaped like an H, whoa
And, you know what else starts with H though
Hockey, shit, thought I had the place flowin
I hate to put you on ice
But you already had three periods in 60 minutes, great goin
Plus you remind me of cocaine, hoe
You always in the mirror with your face so
I feel an urge to put you all in a line and
chop you with a razor blade yo   wait, I'm an a hole
Devil with a halo
Hell yeah I'd nail J Lo, to the railroad~
Say I won't Better hope you can stay afloat
when I take the wind out your sailboat
But, I ain't playin yo
Dope as Shady Don't kid yourself, bitch you ain't even a baby goat

Block Guard Mr. Yayo. You're free to go
So I guess this means I'll see you tomorrow, eh
Block guard laughsEminem laughs
Eminem Yeah Haha. Guess who's home
Tony Yayo Yeah Obie Trice c'mon
Tony Yayo Here we go now

I'm a drama setter, grippin my berretta
Sippin Armeretta, man you crazy
If you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie
You can bet it, just don't get in the way
Of my cheddar, man cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go looking for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin up
Cause I'm a drama setter

Tony Yayo
Told you man, I'm Riker's Island Pokemon
I got COs bringing me filet mignon
But now a nigga home lookin frail in the drop what up
With a bitch shotgun that's inhaling the cock
I got rocks on my neck the size of bottle tops
And got glocks in the Lex so we ride behind cops break it down now
Broke days, we used to put water in our cereal
Now we're crossing borders just to shoot another video
It's Tony Montana on full body armor
Soning niggaz like Alfredo in The Godfather
Two shot revolver, that Dillinger shit
And the AR 15 bending your Six
We taking trips to Morocco just to tan
We smoke weed in restaurants in Amsterdam
I was worth a hundred grams, now I'm worth a cool million
I'll put money on your hairline, your dime and your children

Obie Trice
Since Yayo is home, them A Rs is drawn
Obie's Gorilla Unit, fuck affiliation
We are one, it is senseless for you to prevent this
The 40 cal'll put you up under some photosynthesis
At any given instant gunshot another incident
You just got a glimpse of Obie and Yay's temperment
And we holding them Ks, that's why homie won't age
Isn't it that Tony's enraged, they thow him in cages
But now my nigga's loose, our crews is bulletproof
All brought to you from whom's pupils' baby blues
His short fuses put your portrait on the news
Nigga, them screws is loose when you fuckin with them Shady dudes

Tony Yayo

I got fat while I was gone, but now I'm here
And yall rappers only bust shots only in fear
Chinchillas on my back, itchy fingers on the Mac
Get scrilla off of crack, get 50's shooter back
Listen homie, don't let them niggaz amp you money
Cause I got niggaz in Queens that kill for Pamper money
Move like kaiser, Jayson Williams slaughter the driver
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire
Reality rap, nigga check my salary cap
I give guns to my soldiers with a battery pack
What you know about light planes and heavy coke
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats
It's the rap tycoon, Tony yall all know me
See me on MTV, I'm a parolee
I was out for twelve hours and went right back in
For three hots and one cot doing time in the pen

Tony Yayo Yeah, nigga Thank you Marshall
Eminem Haha, no problem
Tony Yayo We don't stop
Eminem Nah
Tony Yayo Save the best for the last. Talk of New York   Thoughts of a Predicate Felon, baby
Eminem Yeah, man
Tony Yayo Blue Hefner, Lloyd Banks, you know. Buck Marley, Young Buck, Curtis 'Interscope' Jackson
Eminem 'Shady Aftermath' Mathers. Ooh
Tony Yayo Olivia
Eminem O. Trice, Stat Quo
Tony Yayo We gonna keep getting this money, yall rappers gonna keep hatin
Eminem & Tony Yayo  Fuck yall Haha
Tony Yayo Yall want problems I'm built for this shit. Shady Aftermath, G Unit
Eminem & Tony Yayo We run this rap shit

You know what the days of talkin is over
It ain't too much mo' we can say
to try to get these, different individuals
Or motherfuckers as I like to call 'em
To just, shut the fuck up
Let's go

Trick Trick
You witnessed the ass whoopin, bones got broke
When the .50 cal blast, couldn't last through the smoke
As you choke, pay attention, bear winess to this motherfucker twitchin
You excited cause none of the bullets hit you, they missed you
And we ain't trippin, wasn't after you
But you PISSED, just like a bitch when niggaz laughed at you
Now you agitated a little bit, actin just like a little bitch
I figured that you would surface and knew you happened to manage to pop shit
Sayin Trick that, Trick this
When the balls that you had left when I popped him
You shoulda died with him, body and soul coulda burned
I'ma keep killin these bitches 'til everybody learn
FUCK time, and it's time these fuckers just start dyin
I ain't sayin this for sake of this rhyme, and I ain't LYIN
I'm man enough to say it and mean it, niggaz can be gone

There's nothin more these words can say can say
This hard headed motherfucker just won't let it lay let it lay
So say a prayer for this player cause he's goin to his grave to his grave
So stand clear, bitches better get the fuck out my way my way

Proof
Let me show you how I started as a starvin artist
This is Proof with the truth regardless of all this for real
As my CEO and best friend of the essence
of why nobody in Detroit wan' test him huh
Lesson learned, flesh get burned
Tecs in turn, a scar harder than a press and burn
Everlast the beef is over, you can sleep this over
Clique been filled the streets with soldiers
Includin me, I move and creep with uzi fleets
that choose to lead, I'll put your dudes to sleep
Who is he Trick Trick, no treat
That street life, AK that still'll lift your feet blaow
The rest of these niggaz is comical, I'ma go abdominal
Split like a domino, rhymin pro
Shine without a diamond, go Geronimo to any man with balls
Murder you bitches, still screamin FUCK the law

Trick Trick
Since talkin about it is considered as conversation
then I'm more than HAPPY to be the sponsor of demonstrations
From beatin these cases to bustin in faces and bustin these K's
Niggaz gon' act like they don't wanna act right
FUCK THAT Had to begin settin the trend
of organizin a mob, and bringin it to an end
The levels of toleration'll cease, for givin passes
That's why my reputation precedes for beatin asses
Entertainers, they take it as a joke and they tend to provoke
an up and comin undergrad; motherfuckers got me mad
Fuck it, I'ma give it to 'em if you really gon' do 'em
If this motherfucker even BLINKS, put a clip into him
Don't even think of negotiatin a treaty
The reason most of these niggaz is hatin is cause they greedy
Uncovered another man's SHIT, now that's a real bitch
Now the NEXT motherfucker gon' DIE, that's IT~

Kill one of you bitches

Eminem talking
Yeah yeah
Tricky
Let's show 'em some love
Welcome to Detroit

Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I Welcome you to Detroit City
I said Welcome to Detroit City
Every place, everywhere we go
Man we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good man they all say Tricky

Click click boom, just as soon as we hit the room
You can hear 'em holla Goon Squad in this bitch
Let me hear you holla Goon Squad in this bitch
Let me hear you holla Runyon Ave. in this bitch
So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
And the situation gets a little sticky
I'ma dial 911 like a motherfuckin' punk, fuck that, bla bla
I'ma call that rude boy from Detroit, Trick Trick
Quick come pick me up, bring them guns
Come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin' some junk cause he's drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up
Cause uh, somethin' smells a lil' fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me
So homie come get me, Chedda boys what up though I see you
Rock Bottom, yeah I see you, all my Detroit people
Where you at man, let me see them hands in the sky
Detroit motherfuckers 'till we die

Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I Welcome you to Detroit City
I said Welcome to Detroit City
Every place, everywhere we go
Man we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
That's what's good man they all say Tricky

Homie it's been a long time comin' and I'm straight with that
Marshall done called me to 54 and laced the track
This the beat, you hear it bangin', he produced it himself
My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Squad
And gangsta been bangin' the underground since '95, we're bangin'
Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
A quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
And my boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house

Ayo Em, you ever need one of these weapons come get it
From now on every beef that you get in, homie I'm in it
I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
Got a fan base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can fear me
Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fuck with us

Yeah, Trick Trick
Eminem, Wonder Boy, Shady
It's goin' down baby
Ayo Em, I got you back my nigga
Damn right I said my nigga
That's my nigga
Tricky

Detroit What
Bitch, it's Trick Trick, what
And motherfuckin Slim Shady hahaha
I got it back y'all, let's go
Get your motherfuckin hands up

Trick Trick
We been the killers with everything from chest wets to death threats
The best yet, and niggaz gettin they neck checked
Best check them protects
Detroit ain't only known for the best threats so bet, we got next
And hecks collect debt, and rest is Goon Sqwad
We wreck your whole set, we rep the Midwest
You reppin niggaz get wrong, speak on what's on ya songs
We sendin 'em home with stones thrown and broken bones
Better leave us the fuck alone, keep it runnin
You niggaz can't even stomach what the D got comin
We ain't into that frontin and poppin off at the chops boy
We poppin off SHOTS and guaranteein a spot, at the top
First place for niggaz get got
You think you fuckin with Trick and Eminem Well no you NOT
Motherfucker so next time you see us be sure that you make a hole
And when they mention the D you get down on all fours

Got big killers with big guns   who want it
Come to my hood and get some   who want it
You wanna start shit in the club boy   who want it
Touched up   who want it Fucked up   who want it

Eminem
Ooh wow, look at the bitches up in this club
Man I'm gettin me some digits 'fore I leave up out this mug
And it's like boom pow, wham bam thank you ma'am
I ain't kissin you on the lips but I'll be glad to shake your hand
Now let's get blew out, let's start some shit tonight
Just let me pick the chick that I'ma leave here with tonight 'fore we get to fightin 
and threw out, this music makes me rowdy
How they gonna play that new Trick Trick and expect no one to get their shit split
It's just too wild, and one more shot of Hpnotiq
And I am not in control of my body, I go robotic
and blow a fuse out, homies is like He's startin to stagger
And I'm like naw that's just my swagger and I'm dancin with this fat girl
and gettin loose now, I don't wanna fight, I feel like partyin
'til this idiot dumps his Bacardi on my cardi' and 
knocks my screws out   it never fails
I know I'm goin to jail, I might as well take the laces out my shoes now

Trick Trick
I hear 'em screamin Goddamn it, there go that Eminem and them
It ain't no hittin him, they think that we just clicked up but he been with them
It's Trick and them Goon Sqwad gangstas, you can't get to him
We down for the bang and the brawl, but now we killin them
See ever since we started you mighta had to pardon our hardest
from the largest city, they sayin that we retarded
And charges been brought us owners has stopped, some of they artists got dropped
You think I'm playin then bring it, c'mon let's see what you got
We make the club go bang, you got that light noise
See ain't nobody fuckin with this nigga and this white boy
that been through the ringers and the pros, treated they best like hoes
We put the dogs on 'em and make 'em beat 'em outta they clothes
And we don't give a fuck about nothin you used to do
Yo' record is equivalent to High School Musical
No blamin Jimmy Iovine, Paul or Dre
Blame ME for everythang I say; cause I got 'em nigga

No damn body hell naw
Fuck around and cut one of you niggaz heads off

Eminem
Said you want a little company
And I love it cause the thrill's cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here he'd wanna KILL ME
But it's time you met the real me
Filthy, but wasn't always will be
Your pill re fill and I'll still be
your addiction, you can touch a prescription but don't fill/feel me
I let you see my dark side
But like a mic check, you got one two/too
So when the sparks fly
We hit the flight deck and got sprung, pew
Like an ejector seat, from an F 15
But tonight we don't need those pills, just the effects of each
other, but we gon' film
Cause I will want your ex to see
Get it That

I only call you when it's half, past, five
The only time that I'll be by, your, side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half, past, five
The only time I'd ever call, you, mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Eminem
And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Was your shoulder to cry on
And I'll be damned if I weren't who, you turn to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don't ya don't ya remember when I told ya told ya
I would never let down my guard
And I hope ya hope ya feel like dirt when I hold ya hold ya
Cause is it really over
But you just want a little company
And you just really want a thrill seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans
Or you just wanna be guilt free, and still creep
But these hills see, from that POV
We can touch but the only way you'll film me
is with a camera, feel me
You're nothin but a barfly
You got your sights set, on the one who you run to
But I'm a far cry
from what you might get, if we come true
So keep textin me
But at night, if you seek those thrills, what I expect to be
Cause if you cheat on him, just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities
Just sex, and don't lecture me
Just accept, that

The Weeknd

Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you

Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

Xzibit
Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight
Bein underrated gave me time to create it
Can you relate  I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin but hate
Millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin up for my shows
You know how it goes; I might as well kick it at home
But my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me yeah
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin for what, so I can blow up
marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up
FUCK THAT, this the fuckin thanks I get
for tryin to edutain assholes and feed my bitch
Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down upside down
cause you seein more support than I'm seein my child
It's like..

Eminem
.. everyday I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive, survivin this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
without these cameras in our faces like animals
for your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulence up the avenue
and catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
and what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
whether it's unloaded full or an un registered one
No bullet, you're so full of shit
this clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it
And don't give me no bullshit I'm not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude
over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit
Don't tell me bout the show business shit
I know what this is, bitch

Xzibit
This ain't business, this is personal BITCH
You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed
I had a very FUCKED UP day, I'm needin this fit
Shuttin motherfuckers up like they pleadin the 5th
Yo Em it's time to get serious with it yeah
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
Ain't no love lost my niggaz, relax yo'self
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth
To my niggaz who never seen it I mean it when I holla
at the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones
Got, tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin your channel, you played like a fuckin piano
Ridin slow through Cali like I'm ridin a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now
Just hit me on my tele' nigga soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke, that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch ass nigga that's droppin the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise grip
and turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit

Eminem
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
a front door with twelve locks
and have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
and everytime somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops
Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots
and one in the chamber, gun in the waist
and one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place
tryin to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not
gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face
And it's a disgrace Hailey can't play with her toys
in the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn
screamin some shit, leanin out your windows, beepin n shit
Or pullin up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
so my address ends up on the internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin them
that if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters, blow it out of proportion
Oh, now he's pullin guns on his fans
just for tryin to stand on his porch
And I'm the bad guy, cause I don't answer my door like Hey hi
You guys wants some autographs  Okay, form a straight line
Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle
and climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you
It's not that I don't like you..
.. it's just that I'm not behind the mic
I'm a person who's just like you

Eminem
This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
Whattup X

I float like B.I.G.'s spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby
if I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me
to do war, and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out
With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now

Xzibit
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me
and make ends meet
Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now

I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two zero zero three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name

Xzibit
Why do you hate me Hate me I came from nothin
Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me Doubt me You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit Bullshit I struggle for survival
And now you tryin to act like my rival
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
all the pain all the pain all the agony all the agony
All the horror all the horrow all the tragedy all the tragedy
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life C'mon One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the FUCK Who the FUCK you think you talkin to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in FRONT OF YOU

Eminem
I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I coulda been like Treach, boom bapped and slapped him
purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels
I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I Square Dance cause I'm sick of rappin circles
around these clowns, stready tryin to call me out
It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about   c'mon
I No gangsta you ain't either
Will But I know that I spit Ether
Not I shit across your belly
Lose Show you I'm not R. Kelly
X, pass me the weed, I'ma put my ashes out on his ass

Eminem
For the last time man, I'm through

Yelawolf
Ain't never been much of the church type
But I believe in the last dayyyyys
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathwayyyyy
Say boy what you doin with your life
with those tattoos on your faaaaace
Say boy you know that you'll pay the price
Well I guess I'll see when I head that wayyyyy

To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, I hold you nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with your appearance, I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit, behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah

Yelawolf
I don't know much about holy bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my momma's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believin in
But if you spit on my fuckin grave
And wish me Hell then I wish you well, I'ma send you straight up to my best friend

Eminem   Yelawolf
God please would you arm me with the armor to calm me when there's drama
like Gandhi, coulda gone the other way many times, coulda turned Dalai with the  Lama 
But I squashed my, beefs and things seem to be lookin decent recently but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood lookin for peace, though maybe not fin' to enter, the priesthood
But at least should make an attempt to show some remorse and then be some sort of a repenter
for the people I've been a menace to, not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Into the mind of a thick skin but a short temper, this patience of mine is, thinner
than twine is when I, get attacked so I might say somethin back that might offend ya
So if you don't like when I rap of what I have to say on the mic then ya
might wanna act just like quarterbacks and take a fuckin hike when I snap cause, I'm a sinner
And uh I got a best friend, best friend bust balls and intestines, and ain't never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin up the minute I'm ever givin it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it comin cause failure's somethin I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my guts so unless you're my fuckin belly button, don't tell me nothin
You ain't my best friend, best friend who you think I'm talkin 'bout
Lifts me up when I'm down and out, still look to him without a doubt
Still got a best friend, best friend shout it out, like there's never been a louder mouth
Shoulda never been allowed, I'm out, now that I got a higher power now
With a blackout power outage, oww Like powerless but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds, to black sheep but I'll be the worst thing
that these motherfuckers ever heard, when I'm counted out, you be D.O.A. then announced
They pronounce you dead when they sound it out, so prepare for arrival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you POW not even a doctor's at the hospital, he coulda shiggy shocked
you back to life, just im piggy possible to revive you, that's word to the diggy doc
Stiggy stoppin is not an option, somethin I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip hop when I walk in the booth, dawg I'm the truth
like Biggie rockin with 2Pac in a suit, talkin to Proof droppin a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable strip, cock and I shoot
that I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And they be waitin at the gate when you get sprayed up, sendin you hoes straight up
to deal with my best friend

singers
Mmmmmmmmmmm
In this world
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh

Yeah, aight Marshall
Uhh so I think you need to tell 'em
Uhh, who am I
And now you need to bring 'em into this world~

It's gettin hard to be me
Everywhere I go somebody's lookin at me
And if I ever need somethin I'ma get it for myself
Cause I'm the only person thinkin 'bout me in this world
It's gettin hard to be me
Everywhere I go somebody's lookin at me
And if you gon' compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I'm the only person fuckin with me in this world

Yelawolf
In this world of sticks, hicks and chicks with Aqua Net spray
Sh sh shhhh, shut up motherfucker don't disrespect these country ways
Yeah, Alabama if y'ain't know
I ain't hidin a damn thing, I just like to lean low
Yeah I'm the theme show, stereotypical beanpole
Slim, tall, tatted, let me add that I got a green glow
from all the Mountain Dew that I consume
From a mason jar, in a racin car, chase it with a tall ice brew
Let me not leave you confused what I represent culturally
Trash bag full of Freon, I'm huffin puffin on potpourri
That gummo's squeaky, swingin gate in front of that trap house
Trailer park is sewed up, and Billy done pulled that 'llac out in this world

Yelawolf
Wonder what I got inside this Chevrolet trunk, I'm hidin
about ten bodies on a fishin line with, baby clothes on consignment
Came to the game so broke that I still find $1 bills and get a thrill
That's the kind of shit that leaves my pickle dill'd
Side of a single wide got icicles still, too cold
Got a kerosene heater to heat up the grill, meatloaf
Daddy's in jail again for shufflin pills, we know
Man I've only come to give you a peep show in this world
I run across the South like a wild stream, smiling
I've seen more colorful mushrooms than a child's dream
On an island, desolate, left behind cause my state's a state of crime
God said, 1979, go change the minds in this world

Yelawolf
Yelawolf, hi my name is
President O bama, I'm so shameless
I'm takin it all, so what am I sayin
I'm the voice of every small town in this world
Like a light and a pipe with a mic and take flight in this life
What a sight, put a vice grip, lock on my right to fight
Despite the way you may feel about sights and sounds that I might
put down about prices found on a sack of that white
Heaven is a place in a 7/11, I can never get away from hell
Found hell in the Bible Belt and found love in a 6 pack on the shelf
Went to the seashore to see more but Leroy didn't seem sure to me
So I took Leroy to Alabama, he bought the hat, and bought the tee
Coverted him y'all, I gave him convertible thoughts
When he saw that big buck hangin on the wall
Yeah, I'm off by a millimeter, I'm on by a million light years and two liters
A pint of moonshine; I ride a two seater so take a ride in this world

Ay Boo, get these motherfuckers
And pass that Jack

I see you bitches talkin loud but you ain't sayin shit

lines and bars that I launch, here the king of archery come

And I'm stuntin like my daddy, dr dr dr dr drinkin like my momma

Right Yeah hoe But I just hit the surface
And I'm about to walk into a bank with a shank and a black can of paint and check the clerk
Where the keys Bitch you better check your purse, I got a brick of herb
And I hit the syrup, and I'm feelin like I might just hit the curb

Gangsta Boo

Eminem
Me and, Yela wolf, tear the, roof, off this motherfucker
You ain't got the oomph, you're a hoof, to the foot of an elephant
Hello toots, you look so eloquent, that's what I tell a cunt
Come sit up front cause you're kickin my seat and I'm tryin to tell the cashier what I want
They say I act like an asshole, when I pull up at the White Castle
and I ask for an appli cation, throw it back in their face and tell the bitch I'm a rapper
Then I whack her in the head with a Whopper that I bought from BK, you expect me to be proper
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately slut hoe Skeedideedada
Prada Not a, chance, I was thinkin about buying you some clothes 
but Target was closed so I decided to mosey on over to K Mart but the do's
was locked, what about some shoes I thought, great I suppose
So I go to Payless but what d'ya know, they didn't carry a size 8 in HOES~
OHH This is, ugly, boy, swag
Putting, toe, tags, on you, mother fuckin, hoe, bags
What a, trailer, trash, pioneer, I am yeah, that's why I'm here
I don't got a rhyme book, it's more like a motherfuckin diary of, DIARRHEA
Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thang or two
about sign language, middle fingers aimed at you so we don't gotta SCREAM AT YOU~
OWW I just bit my bottom lip, it was an accident
I went to go tell 'em all to go get FUCKED
But I'm never gonna bite my tongue, little bitch throw it up

Gangsta Boo
I see you bitches talkin loud but you ain't say...

Young Buck
You know.. growin up in the hood
You go through all kind of thangs, ya heard
Some of it's good, some of it's bad
But the thangs you go through in life, make you who you are
LOOK AT ME NOW

And from the day I was born I've been hustlin strong
I've been strugglin since a child, now them days is gone
And niggaz said I wouldn't do it now I'm provin 'em wrong
And now they got their hands out like I owe them some
I ain't got time for the bickerin and carryin on
It ain't too much in the hood I don't know
How many times do I have to say that I'm grown
That I'ma Young Buck and still enough to know when you niggaz is hoes

I still remember them nights under the street light
Fiends don't give a damn, they want who got the cheap price AIGHT
I'm tryin to get right, get it in dough
You see people is dyin fast and the money is slow
We used to hang in front of the sto', flag down cars
to be a movie star, go get a glass jar woo
Once you cook it and cut it homey go stand out in public
See the work sell itself if you got enough of it FO' SHO'
Plenty thugs been shot but see it's all in the game
Even I took a couple of 'em, but still I remain
I ain't different from that same lil' project figure
I done went with no lights and no water nigga
And I'm still hood, that mean I still could
get on the block, and get mine like you should yeah
How can I be good, when rappers wanna be Suge
Surroundin myself with family, so I can sleep good

I would light me a cancer stick, thinkin how can I get
my momma out the bricks and my whole clique legit
Lil' Jimmy and the feds, it's just me and some Teds
We cuttin heads, doin whatever to buy a loaf of bread GIMME DAT
The high speed chases, I really loved it
to blow 50 G's and don't thank nothin of it
We showed love but wasn't no love showed back
Whoa Kemosabe what happened what part of the game is that
It's a fact and my war wounds on me can prove it
But look how you made me go and show you I can do it FO' SHO'
I solemnly swear to hold it down for my homeboys WHAT
Locked up and don't know if they ever comin home boy
Time keeps tickin, another baby's born
that's gon' go through the same stuff that I went through and more
You wonder why I hustle, my life's on the line
My baby gotta have milk when she crying, c'mon now

Now everybody got they hand out whatchu want
Crackhead Willie spent his millions 'til they ranned out
Shorty don't wanna holla now because her man out
But just last week, I couldn't get it out her damn mouth ha ha ha
Nowhere to go, look like I'm stuck in these bricks
Seem like the good die young, the bad get rich quick, enough of this
Let me take it to a whole 'nother level what
Like stoppin the po lice from rollin through the ghetto FO' SHO'
Ain't nuttin gettin better but the bills gotta be paid
And money come up short then them tecs gotta get sprayed b r r ap
E'rybody got a grave, we just waitin to go to it
No matter what we do y'all we're still gon' go through it
Some say that I'm heartless, and don't give a damn
But they will never understand, until they get a gram
And this is who I am, not who I wanna be
Open up yo' eyes and see, what these streets done done to me
