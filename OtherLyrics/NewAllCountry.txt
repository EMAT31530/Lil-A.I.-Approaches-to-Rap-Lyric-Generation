one day and under his knees was a raging black stallion and walking behind was a bay the red-headed stranger had eyes like thunder and his lips they were sad and tight his little lost love lay asleep on the hillside and his heart was heavy as night  dont cross him dont boss him hes wild in his sorrow hes riding and hiding his pain dont fight him dont spite him just wait til tomorrow maybe hell ride on again  a yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window and watched as he passed her way she drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion but cast greedy eyes on the bay but how could she know that this dancing bay pony meant more to him than life for this was the horse that his little lost darling had ridden when she was his wife  dont cross him dont boss him hes wild in his sorrow hes riding and hiding his pain dont fight him dont spite him just wait till tomorrow maybe hell ride on again  the yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern and looked up the stranger there he bought her a drink and he gave her some money he just didnt seem to care she followed him out as he saddled his stallion and laughed as she grabbed at the bay he shot her so quick they had no time to warn her she never heard anyone say  "dont cross him dont boss him "hes wild in his sorrow "hes riding and hiding his pain "dont fight him dont spite him "just wait til tomorrow "maybe hell ride on again"  the yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset the stranger went free of course for you cant hang a man for killing a woman whos trying to steal your horse this is the tale of the red headed stranger and if

sometimes i wonder why i spend the lonely nights dreaming of a song the melody haunts my reverie and i am once again with you when our love was new and each kiss an inspiration but that was long ago and now my consolation is in the stardust of a song beside the garden wall when stars are bright you are in my arms the nightingale tells his fairy tale a paradise where roses bloom  though i dream in

of a man how he loved her so dearly he went out of his mind when she left him for someone that shed left behind he cried like a baby he screamed like a panther in the middle of the night and he

many a strange impulse out on the plains of west texas theres many a young boy who feels things he cant comprehend and a small town dont like it when somebody falls between sexes no a small town dont like it when a cowboy has feelings for men and i believe to my soul that inside every man theres the feminine and inside every lady theres a deep manly voice loud and clear well a cowboy may brag about things that hes done with his women but the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other say what do you think all them saddles and boots was about and theres many a cowboy who dont understand the way that he feels for his brother and inside every cowboy theres a lady thatd love to slip out and theres always somebody who says what the others just whisper and mostly that someones the first one to get shot down dead so when you talk to a cowboy dont treat him like he was a sister you cant fuck with a lady thats sleepin in each cowboys head cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other what did you think all them saddles and boots was about and theres many a cowboy who dont understand the way that he feels for his brother and inside every lady theres a cowboy who wants to come out and inside every cowboy theres a lady thatd love to slip out blue skies smiling at me nothing but blue skies do i see

school one day with a shiner on my eye fighting was against the rules and it didn’t matter why when dad got home i told that story just like i’d rehearsed then stood there on those trembling knees and waited for the worst  and he said “let me tell you a secret about a father’s love a secret that my daddy said was just between us he said daddies don’t just love their children every now and then it’s a love without end amen it’s a love without end amen”  when i became a father in the spring of ‘81 there was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father’s son and when i thought my patience had been tested to the end i took my daddy’s secret and i passed it on to him  and i said “let me tell you a secret about a father’s love a secret that my daddy said was just between us i said daddies don’t just love their children every now and then it’s a love without end amen it’s a love without end amen”  last night i dreamed i’d died and stood outside those pearly gates when suddenly i realized there must be some mistake if they know half the stuff i done they’ll never let me in then somewhere from the other side i heard these words again  and they said “let me tell you a secret about a father’s love a secret that my daddy said was just between us you see daddies don’t just love their children every now and then it’s a love without end amen it’s a love without end amen" she was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress summer tanned pretty little perfect mess with a story that could only be anybodys guess and i was thinking that i probably didnt stand a chance but i rolled up my sleeves walked up and i said hey i know i dont know you but id kinda like a shot she said i saw you coming over i already thought it over and okay so now what  and i said well i got a car she said theres something at least its a start i said its better than nothing i aint in no hurry but im ready when you are and she said where do you think all this is going i said there aint no way of knowing i guess i hadnt thought it through that far but i got a car  so we let the wheels turn and the windows down we let ourselves go all the way through town she never said stop and i never asked her why we drove into the night when outta nowhere she said id give anything to never go back there and i kinda wish this day would never end she said i could use a change but i dont even know where to begin  and i said well i got a car she said theres something at least its a start i said its better than nothing i aint in no hurry but im ready when you are and she said where do you think all this is going i said there aint no way of knowing i really hadnt thought it through that far i cant promise you the moon and stars but i got a car  we got lost in the miles lost track of the days til we finally found a stopping place when the doctor said you know whats on the way and we found ourselves in a little white house one sunday morning rain pouring down she said i think its time but all the lines

sunday morning with no way to hold my head that didnt hurt and the beer i had for breakfast wasnt bad so i had one more for dessert then i fumbled through my closet for my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt and i shaved my face and combed my hair and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day id smoked my brain the night before on cigarettes and songs that id been pickin but i lit my first and watched a small kid cussin at  a can that he was kickin then i crossed the empty street and caught the sunday smell of someone fryin chicken and it took me back to somethin that id lost somehow somewhere along the way on the sunday morning sidewalks wishing lord that i was stoned cause theres something in a sunday that makes a body feel alone and theres nothin short of dyin half as lonesome as the sound on the sleepin city sidewalks sunday mornin comin down in the park i saw a daddy with a laughing little girl who he was swingin and i stopped beside a sunday school and listened to the song that they were singin then i headed back for home and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin and it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams of yesterday on the sunday morning sidewalks wishing lord that i was stoned cause theres something in a sunday makes a body feel alone and theres nothin short of dyin half as lonesome as the sound on the sleepin city sidewalk sunday mornin comin down do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do {intro: spoken} i started writing a song about chris gentry and ended up writing about dennis hopper  johnny cash norman norbert funky donnie fritts billy swan bobby neuwirth jerry jeff walker  paul siebel…and ramblin’ jack elliott had a lot to do with it {intro - musical}  see him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans wearin yesterdays misfortunes like a smile once he had a future full of money love and dreams which he spent like they was goin outta style and he keeps right on a-changin for the better or the worse searchin for a shrine hes never found never knowin if believin is a blessin or a curse or if the goin up was worth the comin down  hes a poet and hes a picker hes a prophet and hes a pusher hes a pilgrim and a preacher and a problem when hes stoned hes a walkin contradiction partly truth and partly fiction takin every wrong direction on his lonely way back home  he has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars and hes traded in tomorrow for today runnin from his devils lord and reachin for the stars and losin all hes loved along the way but if this world keeps right on turnin for the better or the worse and all he ever gets is older and around from the rockin of the cradle to the rollin of the hearse the goin up was worth the comin down  hes a poet and hes a picker hes a prophet and hes a pusher hes a pilgrim and a preacher and a problem when hes stoned hes a walkin contradiction partly truth and partly fiction takin every wrong direction on his lonely way back home  theres a lot o wrong directions on that lonely way back home {intro} take the ribbon from your hair shake it loose and let it fall lay it soft against my skin like the shadows on the wall come and lay down by my side till the early morning light all im takin is your time help me make it through the night i dont care whats right or wrong i dont try to understand let the devil take tomorrow lord tonight i need a friend yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrows out of sight and its sad to be alone help me make it through the night {bridge} i dont care whats right or wrong yes i do  i dont try to understand let the devil take tomorrow lord tonight i need a friend yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrows out of sight lord its bad to be alone help me make it through the night {intro} dont look so sad i know its over but life goes on and this old world will keep on turning lets just be glad we had some time to spend together theres no need to watch the bridges that were burning lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm and tender body close to mine hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin soft against the window and make believe you love me one more time for the good times ill get along; youll find another and ill be here if you should find you ever need me dont say a word about tomorrow or forever therell be time enough for sadness when you leave me lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm and tender body close to mine hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin soft against the window and make believe you love me one more time for the good times {outro} a couple of years back i come across a great and wasted friend of mine in the hallway of a recording studio and while he was reciting some poetry to me that hed written i saw that he was about a step away from dyin and i couldnt help but wonder why and the lines of this song occurred to me im happy to say hes no longer wasted and hes got him a good woman and id like to dedicate this to john and june who helped show me how to beat the devil  it was winter time in nashville down on music city row and i was lookin for a place to get myself out of the cold to warm the frozen feelin that was eatin at my soul keep the chilly wind off my guitar my thirsty wanted whisky my hungry needed beans but itd been of month of paydays since id heard that eagle scream so with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams i left my pride and stepped inside a bar actually i guess youd call it a "tavern" cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor friendly shadows  i saw that there was just one old man sittin at the bar and in the mirror i could see him checkin me and my guitar and he turned and said "come up here boy and show us what you are" i said "im dry" and he bought me a beer he nodded at my guitar and said "its a tough life aint it" i just looked at him he said "you aint makin any money are you" i said  "youve been readin my mail" he just smiled and said "let me see that guitar "ive got something you oughta hear" then he laid it on me:  if you waste your time a-talkin to the people who dont listen to the things that you are sayin who do you thinks gonna hear and if you should die explainin how the things that they complain about are things they could be changin who do you thinks gonna care" there were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind who were crucified for what they tried to show and their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time cause the truth remains that no one wants to know  well the old man was a stranger but id heard his song before back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door when no one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor and lonesome was more than a state of mind you see the devil haunts a hungry man if you dont wanna join him you got to beat him i aint sayin i beat the devil but i drank his beer for nothing then i stole his song  and you still can hear me singin to the people who dont listen to the things that i am sayin prayin someones gonna hear and i guess ill die explaining how the things that they complain about are things they could be changin hopin someones gonna care i was born a lonely singer and im bound to die the same but ive got to feed the hunger in my soul and if i never have a nickel i wont ever die ashamed cause i dont believe that no one wants to know casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down the stairway to the subway in the shadows down below following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors of silent desperation never speakin to a soul  the poison air hes breathin has the dirty smell of dyin cause its never seen the sunshine and its never felt the rain but casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes of the clickin of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains  "oh" she said "casey its been so long since ive seen you" "here" she said "just a kiss to make a body smile" "see" she said "ive put on new stockings just to please you" "lord" she said "casey can you only stay a while"  casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown for something wet to wipe away the chill thats on his bone seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men who reach for anything they can to keep from goin home  standin in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by then he stumbles as hes leaving and he wonders if the reason is the beer thats in his belly or the tear thats in his eye  "oh" she said "i suppose you seldom think about me" "now" she said "now that youve a family of your own" "still" she said "its so blessed good to feel your body" "lord" she said "casey its a shame to be alone" {intro} i have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the sky aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as i lay dying healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes  waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin wiping out the traces of the people and the places that ive been teaching me that yesterday was something that i never thought of trying talking of tomorrow and the money love and time we had to spend  loving her was easier than anything ill ever do again  coming close together with a feeling that ive never known before in my time she aint ashamed to be a woman nor afraid to be a friend i dont know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind but dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end  and loving her was easier than anything ill ever do again  mmm mmm ah the scene was a small roadside cafe the waitress was sweeping the floor two truck-drivers drinkinf their coffee and two okie kids by the door "how much are them candies" they asked her "how much have you got" she replied "weve only a penny

the years i go wonderin once again back to the seasons of my youth i recall a box of rags that someone gave us and how my momma put the rags to use there were rags of many colors and every piece was small and i didnt have a coat and it was way down in the fall momma sewed the rags together sewin every piece with love she made my coat of many colors that i was so proud of as she sewed she told a story from the bible she had read about a coat of many colors joseph wore and then she said "perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness" and i just couldnt wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss my coat of many colors that my momma made for me made only from rags but i wore it so proudly although we had no money oh i was rich as i could be in my coat of many colors my momma made for me so with patches on my britches holes in both my shoes in my coat of many colors i hurried off to school just to find the others laughing and making fun of me and my coat of many colors my momma made for me and oh i couldnt understand that for i thought i was rich and then i told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch and i told em all the story momma told me while she sewed and why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes they didnt understand it and i tried to make them see one is only poor only if you choose to be it is true we had no money but i was rich as i could be in my coat of many colors momma made for me made just for me i could hold out my arms say "i love you this much" i could tell you how long i will long for your touch

the windows fastened down i spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound half in hope of sorrow and half in fear the day would find the soldiers breakin through to drag us all away and just before the sunrise i heard something at the wall the gate began to rattle and a voice began to call i hurried to the window looked down into the street expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet but there was no one there but mary so i went down to let her in john stood there beside me as she told me where shed been she said theyve moved him in the night and none of us know where the stones been rolled away and now his body isnt there we both ran towards the garden then john ran on ahead we found the stone and empty tomb just the way that mary said but the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell and how or where theyd taken him was more than i could tell oh something strange had happened there just what i did not know john believed a miracle but i just turned to go circumstance and speculation couldnt lift me very high cause id seen them crucify him then i saw him die back inside the house again the guilt and anguish came everything id promised him just added to my shame when at last it came to choices i denied i knew his name and even if he was alive it wouldnt be the same but suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room and jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide and i fell down on my knees and i just clung to him and cried then he raised me to my feet and as i looked into his eyes the love was shining out from him like sunlight from the skies guilt in my confusion disappeared in sweet release and every fear i ever had just melted into peace hes alive yes hes alive yes hes alive and im forgiven heavens gates are open wide hes alive yes hes alive oh hes alive and im forgiven heavens gates are open wide hes alive hes alive hallelujah hes alive hes alive and im forgiven heavens gates are open wide hes alive hes alive hes alive i believe it hes alive sweet jesus new york city aint no kind of place for a country girl with a friendly face

the time when the bloom was on the cotton when our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings winter cares which were already few or soon forgotten just sittin on the front porch swing

on the front porch swing where was i when the time came to join the married ladies why did i paint the nail when the finger had no ring why do i sit at night at my age to hold their baby sittin on the front porch swing when the mind longs to follow but the memory erases and the lips form the words that the heart no longer sings when the leaves in the hollow have been died to match our faces sittin on the front porch swing oh well dream of the time when the bloom was on the cotton when our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings but the words to the rhyme are the only things

dream to cling to mommys gonna love you just as much as she can and she can  its a good thing you dont have bus-fare it would fall through the hole in your pocket and youd lose it in the snow on the

much as she can and she can living in the love of the common people smiles from the heart of a family man daddys gonna buy you a dream to cling to mommys gonna love you just as much as she can and she can do you remember days not so very long ago when the world was run by people twice your size and the days were full of laughter and the nights were full of stars and when you grew tired you could close your eyes yes the stars were there for wishing and the wind was there for kites and the morning sun was there for rise and shine and even if the sniffles kept you home from school in bed you couldnt hardly stay there after nine and i wonder if the smell of mornings faded what happened to the robins song that sparkled in the sky wheres all the water gone that tumbled down the stream will i ever catch another butterfly  do you remember campouts right in your own backyard wondering how airplanes could fly and the hours spent just playing with a funny rock you found with crystal specks as blue as all the sky and i wonder if the smell of mornings faded what happened to the robins song that sparkled in the sky wheres all the water gone that tumbled down the stream will i ever catch another butterfly  now i watch my son hes playing with his toys hes happy i give him all i can but i cant help feeling just a little tingly inside when i hear him say he wants to be a man and i wonder if the smell of mornings faded what happened to the robins song that sparkled in the sky wheres all the water gone that tumbled down the stream will i ever catch another butterfly yes i been dreaming about you every day each and every day and i been thinking about all night long i even wrote a song just to try and tell you how i really feel to make you understand my love is real that youre on my mind all the time i wish to god you were mine once again  i remember talking to you i remember walking with you i remember laughing all the time when you were mine now the days seem so long i cant face the night alone i beg you please wont you please come home  i remember talking to you i remember walking with you i remember laughing all the time when you were mine now the days seem so long i cant face the night alone i beg you please wont you please come home if i look like home to you if i am your sign dont try to understand it girl when i draw the line it hasnt come to this that you can say i waste my time looking everywhere going nowhere  for the skies they look so lazy now heavy are the clouds theres nothing here that i can learn of what its all about you havent said a thing to me you talk so very loud looking everywhere going nowhere  well i think ill try the circus or go back to mexico its time to make mistakes again its time to change the show its time and time and time again to find another way its time to gather forces and get out of yesterday because i lost what i was looking for theres nothing left to share i need to take myself away to be some other where a face a life a minute more i dont think i can spare looking everywhere going nowhere  cause i tell you when you hurt me and you just dont seem to know i inform you when im lonely and you still dont think ill go so if i lie to you and smile a thought thats only halfway here its just a circus and im singing im never really near if i look like home to you if i am your sign dont try to understand it girl when i draw the line it hasnt come to this that you can say i waste my time looking everywhere looking everywhere looking anywhere going nowhere when i get older losing my hair many years from now will you still be sending me a valentine birthday greetings bottle of wine if id been out till quarter to three would you lock the door will you still need me will you still feed me when im sixty-four  youll be older too and it you say the word i would stay with you i could be handy mending a fuse when your lights have gone you can knit a sweater by the fireside sunday mornings go for a ride doing the garden digging the weeds who could ask for more will you still need me will you still feed me when im sixty-four  every summer we can rent a cottage in the isle of wight if its not too dear we shall scrimp and save grandchildren on your knee: vera chuck & dave  send me a postcard drop me a line stating point of view indicate precisely what you mean to say yours sincerely wasting away give me your answer fill in a form mine forevermore will you still need me will you still feed me when im sixty-four  so you speak to me of sadness and the coming of the winter the fear that is within you now that seems to never end and the dreams that have escaped you and the hope that youve forgotten and you tell me that you need me now and you want to be my friend and you wonder where were going wheres the rhyme and wheres the reason and its you cannot accept: it is here we must begin to seek the wisdom of the children and the graceful way of flowers in the wind for the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day like the music of the mountains and the colors of the rainbow theyre a promise of the future and a blessing for today  though the cities start to crumble and the towers fall around us the sun is slowly fading and its colder than the sea it is written: from the desert to the mountains they shall lead us by the hand and by the heart they will comfort you and me in their innocence and trusting they will teach us to be free for the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day and the song that i am singing is a prayer to non-believers come and stand beside us we can find a better way its late december and the new years never coming time passes slowly in a two-room walk-up flat the sun is silent theres a cold rains gonna come on no one to talk to but my ladys yellow cat  raindrops falling on the flowers in the window box plastic roses that i planted yesterday i didnt think theyd die so soon but theyre all withered now seems like everything i touch turns out that way  well i guess ill just go walking the cats no good for talking to he dont know what im saying and the rain is always playing on my mind on my mind  street lights drifting through the blinds that cover window-panes blending softy with the bare lights overhead then together they run swiftly through my memory an eerie image of a strange and empty bed  the wind is whipping up the papers in the street below i got some books to read but it seems theyve all been read clouds are crowded in a misty drifting sky above and i wish to hell i could remember what i said  well i guess ill just go walking the cats no good for talking to he dont know what im saying and the rain is always playing on my mind on my mind  one crystal wineglass on a table filled with scarlet stains stands alone and empty where there once were two the jug is silent on the table by a broken plate the wine is gone my lady and so my love are you  well i guess ill just go walking the cats no good for talking to he dont know what im saying and the rain is always playing on my mind on my mind isabel is waiting in a room of many shadows her eyes like flashing diamonds shining brightly from the sea her hair in silken tresses like a robe around her shoulders hiding tantalising treasures that the sun has never seen  isabel is watching like a princess from the mountains for the first soft snows of winter and the icy winds they bring with a whisper of her sadness in the passing of the summer her crown is wild red roses with a lace of forest green  and she wraps her arms around me and she sighs and she sing to me in silence with her eyes and her hair upon my pillow comforts me  isabel is weeping and her eyes are full of wonder she knows that its the time for her and she cannot understand shes a mistress of the moonlight to the stars she is a sister and the morning now awaits her to betray her once again  and she whispers as she sadly slips away then she smiles because theres nothing left to say and she takes with her the sadness and the sun i told you that i loved you you said that is so good i called you my darling i thought i always would but now youve gone and left me i dont know what to do so my little darling i write these words to you  you dun stomped on my heart and you mashed that sucker flat you just sorta stomped on my aorta you started going out with guys i felt us drift apart and every step you took was a stomp on my heart  i only hope that someday you get them low down blues in some smoky honky-tonk youll look down at your shoes youll think about that tender heart that you crushed beneath them soles with your cold busting stompers you left my heart so full of holes  you dun stomped on my heart and you mashed that sucker flat you just sorta stomped on my aorta you started going out with guys i felt us drift apart and every step you took was a stomp on my heart and every step you took was a stomp on my heart  my old man had a rounders soul hed hear an old freight train then hed have to go said hed been blessed with the gypsy bone thats the reason they guessed hed been cursed to roam  came into town back before the war didnt even know what it was he was looking for he carried a tattered bag for his violin it was full of lots of songs and places that hed been he talked real easy had a smiling way to pass along to you when his fiddle played  making people drop their cares and woes to hum out loud those tunes that his fiddle bowed till the people there began to join that sound and everyone in town was laughing singing dancing round like the fiddlers tune was all they heard that night as if some dream said "all the world is right"  his fiddlers eye caught one beauty there she had that rolling flowing golden kind of hair he played for her as if she danced alone he played his favorite songs ones he called his own he played until she was the last to go stopped and packed his case said hed take her home all the nights that passed a child was born all the years that passed love would keep them warm all their lives theyd share a dream come true all because she danced so well to his fiddle tune  my old man had a rounders soul hed hear an old freight train then hed have to go all that i recall he said

things that id like to say say em loud say em clear for the whole round world to hear i wish i could share all the love thats in my heart remove every doubt that keeps us apart and i wish you could

mind the night before with cigarettes and songs id been picking but i lit my first and watched a small kid playing with a can that he was kicking then i walked across the street and caught the sunday smell of someones frying chicken and lord it took me back to something that id lost somewhere somehow along the way on a sunday morning sidewalk im wishing lord that i was stoned cause theres something in a sunday that makes a body feel alone and theres nothing short a dying thats half as lonesome as the sound of the sleeping city sidewalk and sunday morning coming down in the park i saw a daddy with a laughing little girl that he was swinging and i stopped beside a sunday school and listened to the songs they were singing then i headed down the street and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing and it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams of yesterday on a sunday morning sidewalk im wishing lord that i was stoned cause theres something in a sunday that makes a body feel alone and theres nothing short a dying thats half as lonesome as the sound of the sleeping city sidewalk and sunday morning coming down you can run on for a long time run on for a

it was taller by half than the old man himself though it weighed not a pennyweight more it was bought on the morn of the day that he was born and was always his treasure and pride but it stopped short never to go again when the old man died ninety years without slumbering his life seconds numbering it stopped short never to go again when the old man died my grandfather said that of those he could hire not a servant so faithful he found for it wasted no time and had but one desire at the close of each week to be wound and it kept in its place not a frown upon its face and its hands never hung by its side but it stopped short never to go again when the old man died it rang and alarmed in the dead of the night an alarm that for years had been dumb and we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight that his hour for departure had come still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime as we silently stood by his side but it stopped short never to go again when the old man died ninety years without slumbering his life seconds numbering it stopped short never to go again when the old man died some glad morning when this life is oer ill fly away to that home on gods celestial shore ill fly away ill fly away oh glory ill fly away when i die hallelujah by and by ill fly away just a few more weary days and then ill fly away to that land where joy will never end ill fly away

like nuts an bolts and all four shocks but the big stuff we snuck out in my buddys mobile home now up to now my plan went all right til we tried to put it all together one night and thats when we noticed that something was definitely wrong the transmission was a fifty three and the motor turned out to be a seventy three and when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone so we drilled it out so that it would fit and with a little bit of help with an adapter kit we had that engine runnin just like a song now the headlight was another sight we had two on the left and one on the right but when we pulled out the switch all three of em come on the back end looked kinda funny too but we put it together and when we got through well thats when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin about that time my wife walked out and i could see in her eyes that she had her doubts but she opened the door and said "honey take me for a spin" so we drove up town just to get the tags and i headed her right on down main drag i could hear everybody laughin for blocks around but up there at the court house they didnt laugh cause to type it up it took the whole staff and when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds i got it one piece at a time and it wouldnt cost me a dime youll know its me when i come through your town im gonna ride around in style im gonna drive everybody

the peoples trunk constable had to come and take him away sheriff john stone why dont you leave me alone well i feel so homesick i wanna go home then the cook he caught the fits threw out all of my grits then he took and ate up all of my corn let me go home why dont you let me go home well this is the worst trip since i have been born so hoist up the john b sail drink to me only with thine eyes and i will pledge with mine or leave a kiss within the cup and ill not ask for wine the thirst that from the soul doth rise doth ask a drink divine; but might i of joves nectar sip i would not change for thine i sent thee late a rosy wreath not so much honring thee as giving it a hope that there it could not withered be; but thou thereon didst only breathe and sentst it back to me since when it grows and smells i swear not of itself but thee drink to me only with thine eyes and i will pledge with mine or leave a kiss within the cup and ill not ask for wine the thirst that from the soul doth rise doth ask a drink divine; but might i of joves nectar sip i would not change for thine i walked through a county courthouse square on a park bench an old man was sitting there i said your old courthouse is kinda run down he said naw itll do for our little town i said your old flagpole has leaned a little bit and thats a ragged old flag you got hanging on it he said have a seat and i sat down is this the first time youve been to our little town i said i think it is he said i dont like to brag but were kinda proud of that ragged old flag you see we got a little hole in that flag there when washington took it across the delaware and it got powder-burned the night francis scott key sat watching it writing say can you see and it got a bad rip in new orleans with packingham and jackson tuggin at its seams and it almost fell at the alamo beside the texas flag but she waved on though she got cut with a sword at chancellorsville and she got cut again at shiloh hill there was robert e lee beauregard and bragg and the south wind blew hard on that ragged old flag on flanders field in world war one she got a big hole from a bertha gun she turned blood red in world war two she hung limp and low a time or two she was in korea and vietnam she went where she was sent by uncle sam she waved from our ships upon the briny foam and now theyve about quit waving her back here at home in her own good land here shes been abused shes been burned dishonored denied and refused and the government for which she stands is scandalized throughout the land and shes getting threadbare and wearing thin but shes in good shape for the shape shes in cause shes been through the fire before and i believe she can take a whole lot more so we raise her up every morning we take her down every night we dont let her touch the ground and we fold her up right on second thought i do like to brag cause im mighty proud of that ragged old flag im just a poor wayfaring stranger traveling through this world below there is no sickness no toil nor danger in that bright land to which i go im going there to see my father and all my loved ones whove gone on im just going over jordan im just going over home i know dark clouds will gather round me i know my way is hard and steep but beauteous fields arise before me where gods redeemed their vigils keep im going there to see my mother she said shed meet me when i come so im just going over jordan im just going over home im just going over jordan im just going over home on the road again just cant wait to get on the road again the life i love is making music with my friends and i cant wait to get on the road again on the road again goin places that ive never been seein things that i may never see again i cant wait to get on the road again on the road again like a band of gypsies we go down the highway were the best of friends insisting that the world keep turning our way and our way is on the road again just cant wait to get on the road again the life i love is making music with my friends and i cant wait to get on the road again on the road again like a band of gypsies we go down the highway were the best of friends insisting that the world keep turning our way and our way is on the road again just cant wait to get on the road again the life i love is making music with my friends and i cant wait to get on the road again and i cant wait to get on the road again i was a highwayman along the coach roads i did ride with sword and pistol by my side many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade the bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five but i am still alive i was a sailor i was born upon the tide and with the sea i did abide i sailed a schooner round the horn to mexico i went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow and when the yards broke off they said that i got killed but i am living still i was a dam builder across the river deep and wide where steel and water did collide a place called boulder on the wild colorado i slipped and fell into the wet concrete below they buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound but i am still around ill always be around and around and around and around and around i fly a starship across the universe divide and when i reach the other side ill find a place to rest my spirit if i can perhaps i may become a highwayman again or i may simply be a single drop of rain but i will remain and ill be back again and again and again and again and again oh come all you young fellers young and so fine seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mine itll form as a habit and seep in your soul till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal where its dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double
