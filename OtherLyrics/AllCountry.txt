Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you
Jolene He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name
Jolene And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me
Jolene Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me
Jolene I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do
Jolene Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene (Dolly Parton) If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, and but I know
I'll think of you each step of my way
And I will always love you
I will always love you Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I am taking with me
Good-bye, oh, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not
What you need
But I will always love you
I will always love you And I hope life, will treat you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
Oh, I do wish you joy
And I wish you happiness
But above all this
I wish you love
I will always love I will always, always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you (Dolly Parton) The hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow Just a wild rambling rose, seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5 Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me! They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet 9 to 5, whoa what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it 9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet 9 to 5, working 9 to 5 Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet Back through the years I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
"Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness"
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me So with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if you choose to be It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors momma made for me
Made just for me I could hold out my arms, say "I love you this much"
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch
How much and how far would I go to prove
The depth and the breadth of my love for you? From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Love everlasting, I promise you that
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back I want you to know you can always depend
On promises made and love without end
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be
Now and on into eternity From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Forever and always, I'll be where you're at
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat
I would call out your name to echo through the vast
Thank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat
From here to the moon and back
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact
From here to the moon and back From here to the moon and back... Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
I feel it when you're with me
It happens when you kiss me
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside
Your touch is soft and gentle
Your kiss is warm and tender
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies Love is like a butterfly
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing Your laughter brings me sunshine
Everyday is spring time
And I am only happy when you are by my side
How precious is this love we share
How very precious, sweet and rare
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing (Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner) Oh, the pain of loving you
Oh, the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh, the pain of loving you You just can't stand to see me happy
Seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you
But I never understand To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside, there was somethin' going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you did walk in tonight
Slowly losing sight of the real thing But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one, in love forever
We can ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah Sail away
Oh, come sail away with me Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah (Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner) Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't live with you gone
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't make it alone
You bring me the sunshine when none is in sight
And when I'm in darkness, you bring me the light
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
So please, oh, please don't stop loving me You're my inspiration, my purpose in life
When things go all wrong, you make them all right
I would be useless if you ever leave
So please, oh please don't stop loving me Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't live with you gone
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't make it alone
Please, please don't stop loving me An acre of diamonds I'd offer to you
A solid gold mansion, an airplane or two
This whole world would be yours to have and to hold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold The tears that have fallen won't buy you a thing
The heartaches you've caused me won't pay for a ring
The love that I wanted would not have grown cold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold But teardrops aren't pennies
And heartaches aren't gold (Dolly Parton) Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens hede my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain If I were a little sparrow
O'er these mountains I would fly
I would find him,yes I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask him, yes I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold false-hearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain All ye maidens fair and tender
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend Little sparrow, little sparrow
Oh the sorrow never ends Sometimes I try to count the ways and reasons that I love you
But I can't ever seem to count that far
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons
More than this I love you as you are
More than this I love you as you are You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are You are my thoughts when I'm awake, my dreams when I'm asleep
You are the reason for my smile, you are the words I speak
Every role I play in life you play the leading part
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are You are...
You are Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down In dreams of you, my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you're not there, and I'm so lonesome
Without your love I'd go insane Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down I close my eyes and you're there with me
Your kiss I feel, your face I see
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
It's just your haunting memory Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, my little darling
Until the day they lay me down
Until the day they lay me down Peace in the valley for me some day Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must travel on
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh, yes
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night is as bright as the day, oh, yes There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only peace in the valley for me, oh, yes Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh, yes There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
And there'll be no sadness and no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only will be peace in the valley for me, oh, yes
Yes, there will be peace, sweet peace in the valley for me, oh, yes Du-u-u Du-u-u Du-u-u-u-u-u wa Du-u wa My love for you is deeper than the depths of any ocean,
And as faithful as the stars that grace the night,
As constant as the sun making its journey through heavens,
and we'll always be together you and I. --
[Chorus]
Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine.
Paint a pretty rainbow, brushed with love across the sky,
Together you and I belong, like a songbird and a song
and we'll always be together you and I
-- Life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
And as happy as the laughter of a child
As peaceful as a river and as lasting as forever
you know we'll always be together you and I [Chorus] I always be beside or close behind you.
Wherever you go, you'll always know I'll always find you [Chorus] We'll always be together, you and I Forever together, forever you and I
(forever you and I du-du)
Forever together, together you and I will always be
(together, together)
Together, you and I........ You say tomorrow you're going
It's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches
'Cause you're making plans to leave The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the tear drops
'Cause you're making plans to leave You're making plans to forget me
I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready to grieve I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me Chorus: And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories at all
Or do I ever cross your mind Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
Oh, do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling
I just wonder do I cross your mind Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close Chorus: And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old memories at all
Or do I ever cross your mind Do you ever ... (Floyd Parton) I'll do everything I can to make you proud to be my man
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
I guess we're promising a lot, but for now it's all we've got
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side we'll be together always
And if you'll hold me tight when you love me
That's all I'll ask of you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years I'll be your friend, I'll be your lover
Until the end, there'll be no other
'Cause my heart has only room for one
Yes, I'll always love you, and I'll always be here for you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side we'll be together always
And if you'll hold me tight when you love me
That's all I'll ask of you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side, we'll be together always
And, yes, I'll always love you and I'll always be here for you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years, and I'll be here
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Through our rockin' years I want to feel this way
Longer than time
I want to know your dreams
And make them mine
I want to change the world
Only for you
All the impossible
I want to do I want to hold you close under the rain
I want to kiss your smile
And feel your pain
I know what's beautiful
Looking at you
Here in a world of lies
You are the true [Chorus:]
And baby
Everytime you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you
Anything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me I want to make you see
Just what i was
Show you the loneliness
And what it does
You walked into my life
To stop my tears
Everything's easy now
I have you here [Repeat chorus]
In a world without you
I would always hunger
All i need is your love to make me stronger [Repeat chorus] (Dolly Parton) Sittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straightback chair on two legs, leans against the wall
Watch the kids a' playin' with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads it's wings
An' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by Walkin' home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' love
Just laughin', talkin', making future plans
And when the folks ain't lookin', you might steal a kiss or two
Sittin' in the porch swing, holdin' hands In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by (Dolly Parton/Carl Perkins) When it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do
When it's family, you accept them, 'cause you have no choice but to
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you
And they always put you to the test
And you always try to do your best
And just pray for God to do the rest, when it's family Some are preachers, some are gay
Some are addicts, drunks and strays
But not a one is turned away, when it's family
Some are lucky, others ain't
Some are fighters, others faint
Winners, losers, sinners, saints, it's all family And when it's family you trust them and your heart's an open door
When it's family, you tolerate what you'd kill others for
When it's family, you love and hate and take, then give some more
Somehow you justify mistakes, try to find some better way
To solve the problems day to day, in the family You take the trouble as it comes and love them more than anyone
Good or bad or indifferent, it's still family
You choose your lovers, you pick your friends
Not the family that you're in, nah
They'll be with you 'til the end, 'cause it's family And when it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you
When it's family, when it's family
Let me be all that I should be to the family (Dolly Parton) Well a good ways down the railroad track
There was this little old rundown shack
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you better not set foot on his land
I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me out walking down the railroad track
I was a-gonna go down to that little old shack
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say well who are you
Oh and there he stood in the door of that shack
His beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen
When he spoke his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said what you doing snooping 'round my place
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said come on in and pull you up a chair
You might as well since you already here
And he said you can call me Joshua
Joshua Joshua
Whatcha doing living here all alone
Joshua Joshua
Ain't you got nobody to call your own
No no no no We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight
And we still talking when it come daylight
And there was just so much we had to say hey
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home
And just like him I was all alone
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay
Oh we grew closer as time went on
And that little old shack it was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
That big black dog and that little old shack
Sitting down by the railroad track
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua Joshua Joshua
Why you're just what I've been looking for
Joshua Joshua
You ain't gonna be lonesome anymore
No no Yodel-a-he-ho Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua yeah yeah
Me and Joshua (Dolly Parton) Take my hand and run with me
Out of the past of yesterday
And walk with me into the future of tomorrow
Yesterday must be forgot
No looking back no matter what
There's nothing there but mem'ries that bring sorrow Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever No more crying tears leave tracks
And mem'ries find their way back
Tomorrow's waiting let's journey there together Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever I care not for yesterday I love you as you are today
Yesterday just helped to pass the time while waiting
We must forget the passing time
My love for you is the real kind
The kind that won't hurt you, oh never Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever Well, I wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Cause there ain't no smog, no smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bill Now but once I had me a man on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Well, he was wild as a mink but he was sweet as soda-pop
I often think about that Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
And some say they never will Did you know corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top?
The dirt's too rocky by far
And that's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Now I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped luck a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a dad-burn pity
Life can't be simple again Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Rocky Top, Tennessee
Tennessee, Rocky Top It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
As we walk along my thoughts are tumblin'
Round and round, round and round Underneath our feet are someplace rumblin'
Underground, underground
Are you going away
With no word of farewell Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind I've got reason a plenty for goin
This i know, this i know
The weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
I could've loved you better Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
Are you going away
With no word of farewell Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind You know that was the last thing on my mind (Dolly Parton) Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preacher the word of God throughout the land
He preached so plain a child could understand
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of he need to pray
He talked about God's wrath and judgement day
He preached about the great eternity
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
Aunt Leanona would get up to testify
And we'd sing "In The Sweet By And By"
The we'd sing "I'm On My Way To Canaan Land"
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were always filled at altar calls
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Daddy worked for God but asked for no pay
For he believed that God provides a way
We never had a lot but we got by
Guess it's 'cause the Lord was on Daddy's side
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man [Spoken] I've always been misunderstood because of how I look.
Don't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book.
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am.
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam. I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl.
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world,
like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks' catalog.
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all.
I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not there.
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that
I'm as shallow as I look 'cause I run true and deep. I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels.
I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real.
Yes, I can see where I may be misjudged upon first glance.
But even backwoods Barbies deserve a second chance. All dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth,
'Cuz even backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt. To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do I'll be good to him
I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
Yes, just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do Why can't he see
How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me, ooh To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
And I do When the mornin' sun
Streaks across my room
And I'm wakin' up
From another dream of you
Yes, you know I'm on the road
Once again it seems
All that's left behind
Is a chain of broken dreams But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you And how I wish that love
Was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have
'Cause I've got so much to give
But ya' know I feel so sad
Down inside my heart
That the dollar sign
Should be keepin' us apart But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life
Had not yet crossed my mind
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come runnin' back to you
I'd come runnin' back to you But you know we can't
Live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent
So I must leave you all alone
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago
And now this travelin' life
Well, it's the only life I know But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you But you know I love you
But you know I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
But you know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
But you know that I love you If she brings you happiness
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls Though it hurts to let you go
Darling I want you to know
I'll run to you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear
That she's made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away each teardrop you've cried
If she ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls All I Estare Candor me necesites a tu lado
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado
If he ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls I'll be there, I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls (Dolly Parton) My life is like unto a bargain store
And I may have just what you're lookin' for
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
But with a little mending it could be as good as new
Why you take for instance this old broken heart
If you will just replace the missing parts
You would be surprised to find how good it really is
Take it and you never will be sorry that you did The bargain store is open come inside
You can easily afford the price
Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise
And I will guarantee you'll be completely satisfied Take these old used memories from the past
And these broken dreams and plans that didn't last
I'll trade them for a future, I can't use them anymore
I've wasted love but I still have some more The bargain store is open come inside
You can easily afford the price
Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise
And I can guarantee you'll be completely satisfied My life is like unto a bargain store
And I may have just what you're lookin' for
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
With a little mendin' it could be as good as new The bargain store is open, come inside
The bargain store is open, come inside There's a wreath on the door
She don't live here no more
As of today, she flew home
And we all gathered here
In sorrow and tears
It won't be the same with her gone
There's a place on the hill
That's peaceful and still
Where she'll sleep beside daddy again
The ole' family tree is shedding it's leaves
But we'll all met in heaven again Chorus: Oh, she's an angel
Let her fly, let her fly
She's gone home to glory
To her home in the sky
When God sees her comin'
Heaven's choir will smile
And sing, "oh she's an angel, let her fly, let her fly
Ooh, she's an angel, let her fly" She used to rock me when I was a child
Sing "rock of ages" and "in the sweet bye and bye"
Her life wasn't easy, oh but how hard she tried
You know she's an angel, lord, so let her fly Repeat chorus Tag: Let her fly
Ooh she's an angel, let her fly I can't forget you
Ever since the moment that I met you
You've been on my mind
And I need to somehow let you know
That I think about you all the time [Chorus:]
So when you think about love, think about me
I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me We were strangers
Now I'm already wrapped around your finger
Oh what's a heart to do
'Cause it lingers
And the thought of you
Wantin' me as much as I want you [Chorus] Makes me blue
I'm not holding you tonight
'Cause only you can satisfy
This heart of mine [Chorus] Well, good morning, Captain
Good morning to you, Sir
Hey hey yeah Do you need another mule skinner
Down on your new mud run?
Hey hey yeah Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he Well I'm a lady mule skinner
From down old Tennessee way
Hey hey, I come from Tennessee I can make any mule listen
Or I won't accept your pay
Hey hey I won't take your pay Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he Well, hey hey, little water boy
Won't you bring your water 'round?
Hey hey If you don't like your job
Well, you can throw your bucket down
Throw it down boy, throw it down Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he Well, I've been working down in Georgia
At a greasy spoon cafe
Hey, 've been working in Georgia
Just to let a no good man Call every cent of my pay
Hey hey and I'm sick of it
And wanna be a mule skinner Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he
Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he
Mule skinner blues (Traditional) In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
My love, my love, what have I done
To make you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
The caboose went by at nine In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo (Dolly Parton) He lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack
His real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him AppleJack
Now old AppleJack was loved by everyone he ever knew
AppleJack picked apples but he picked the banjo too Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring Now I'd go down to AppleJack's almost everyday
We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old AppleJack had made
Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing
And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown
All I have are memories, old AppleJack is gone
Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back
And everytime I play it I still hear AppleJack Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring It's too late
You say you want me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now It's too bad
You say you need me and it's too bad
I know the feelin' and it's so sad
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now Don't you know how hard I tried
To hold out just for you?
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day Then someone came into my life
Turned my dreams around
He's takin' all the love you threw away It's too late
You say you want me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now Don't you know how hard I tried
To hold out just for you?
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day Then someone came into my life
Turned my world around
He's takin' all the love you threw away It's too late
You say you need me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now Two little children a boy and a girl
Sat by an old church door
The little girl's feet
Were as brown as the curl
That fell on the dress that she wore
The little boy's cloths were all tattered and torn
They shown beneath his blue eyes Why don't you go home
To you mommy I said
And this was the maddens reply
Mommy's in heaven
Angels took her away
Left Tim and I all alone
We've no one to love us
And daddy is dead
And our darling mother is gone Mommy got sick
Angels took her away
To dwell in those mansions so bright
She said she would come
For her children some day
And I guess she's coming tonight
The sexton came early
To ring the church bell
And found them
Beneath the snow white
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell
Up in heaven with their mommy that night (Dolly Parton) She's been there, God knows, she's been there
She has seen and done it all
She's a woman, she know how to
Dish it out or take it all
Her heart's as soft as feathers
Still she weathers stormy skies
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies A kaleidoscope of colors
You can toss her around and round
You can keep her in you vision
But you'll never keep her down
She's a lover, she's a mother
She's a friend and she's a wife
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies Gentle as the sweet magnolia
Strong as steel, her faith and pride
She's an everlasting shoulder
She's the leaning post of life
She hurts deep and when she weeps
She's just as fragile as a child
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies She's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
Oh, bless her, Lord
She's an eagle when she flies I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be
Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that's a different situation He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of
A man that let me down Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman No, my mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman There's a picture that I carry
One we made some time ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just "Someone I use to know" Just someone, I used to spend some time with
Just a flame, that's lost its glow
But I don't them of the nights I cried without you
I say just "Someone I use to know" Just someone, I use to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them, how lost I am without you
I say just "Someone I use to know" I say just "Someone I use to know" (Dolly Parton) Momma never seemed to miss the finer things in life
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
If she did, she never did say so to daddy The only things that seemed to be important in her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Momma never wanted anymore than what she had
If she did, she never did say so to daddy He often left her all alone
She didn't mind the stayin' home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers
And the gifts he never gave her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
She didn't even seem to notice
That he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy One morning we awoke
Just to find the note
That momma carefully wrote
And left to daddy
And as he began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddy She said our kids are old enough
And they don't need me very much
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly
I have needed you so long
But I just can't keep holdin' on
She never meant to come back home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy Momma's gone
Good-bye to daddy Life has dealt us our fair share of pain along the way
And many dreams have withered on the vine
But dreams are all such fleeting things and happiness is now
We'll just live our lives one day at a time In all the stormy weather love has always seen us through
Happiness is knowing that you're mine
Why worry about tomorrow for tomorrow may not come
We'll just live our lives one day at a time This one thing I'm learning you take life as it comes
Each day is just a gift so don't be blind
Tomorrow may bring gladness or a little bit of sadness
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
[ guitar ]
We may not have a fortune making plans to change the world
We may leave little marks in life's design
But as long as we're together every hour is filled with love
And we'll just live our lives one day at a time Just one thing I'm learning...
We'll just live our lives one day at a time You packed in the morning
I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I miss you more
Than I missed you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
Now most every morning
I stare out the window
I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me
'Cause I need you more
Than I needed before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
You packed in the morning I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way Now I love you more
Than I loved you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me Just when I needed you most
You left me
Just when I needed you most
Oh, you left me Just when I needed you most We're holding on to nothing left to hold onto
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'
The years have shown no kindness
For the hard times we've been through We've squeezed the life from every dream
And still go right on bluffin'
With really nothin' left to hold onto Oh, why do we keep holding on
With nothing left to hold onto
Let's be honest with each other
That's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto We were young and foolishly mistaken
Victims of a passion, much too strong to be denied
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'
God only knows how long, how hard we've tried Oh, why do we keep holding on
With nothing left to hold onto
Let's be honest with each other
That's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto TIE A YELLOW RIBBON ROUND THE OLD OAK TREE

Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you. All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again and here I go All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there got all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again, and here I go, here I go
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again and here I go
Here I go You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
The day I met you my heart spoke to me
It said to love you through eternity Now knowing that you were another's bride
I vowed I'll always be close by your side
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still You broke a heart dear that would die for you
I'd give this world dear to belong to you
The game is over now and we've both lost
A broken heart will have to pay the cost You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still I love you so much I can't let you go
And sometimes I believe you love me
But somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a door without any key Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you
[ steel ]
Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile
And I'm left in the middle again Somewhere between your heart and mine... You can dance
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that hold your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me Oh, I know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun

But while we're apart, don't give your heart to anyone
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it with your touch
I will never ever let you go
I love you, oh, so much You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone
Till it's time to go
If she asks
If you're all alone, can she take you home
You got to tell her no And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me Ooh darling, save the last dance for me
You can dance
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that hold your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be

Even death could never end this love of mine I have loved you for so long
With a love both true and strong

Even death could never end this love of mine
If you go, I'll follow you.... With great anticipation he waited at the door
His only son was due from overseas
For months now he'd been waitin' since he'd gone off to war
And his eyes were filled with tears of great relief Welcome home, son
His loving arms held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
I've been prayin' and been hopin' and I never did give up
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long.
I hear him say as they embrace
"I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home." But a dreary rain was falling while another soldier fell
And a mother wakes up crying in the night
She thought she'd heard him calling in that moment she could tell
Her only son had passed into the light Welcome home, son
His loving arems held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
As Jesus stood there glowing, their hands reached out and touched
I knew that you'd return to me
The place that you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
As they embraced I heard him say
"I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home." Now I think of all the families that have lost a darling one
And I think how Jesus died for all our sins
And I think how much God loved us to send his only son
To live and die, and then to live again Welcome home son
I hear God saying when they nailed Christ to the cross that day
Welcome home son
And when he sent his angels to roll that stone away
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
I hear God say as they embrace
"I've waited so long for this day
Well done my faithful son... Welcome home." Welcome home!
I hope to hear God saying when it's my time to go!
Welcome home!
While the angel band is playing and God comes to claim my soul!
The angels will be singing and joybells will be ringing!
Rejoicing! I'll shout and sing along!
When there are no more wars to fight
And we're all children of the light
When the father and the son say
"Welcome home!" Tag: Welcome home, welcome home, welcome home. You ought to go north somebody told us
'Cause the air is filled with gold dust
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
Now I don't recall who said it
But we'd spent our lives on credit
And so we headed out to find our promised land Just poor Smokey Mountains farm folk
With nothing more than high hopes
So we hitched our station wagon to a star
But our dreams all fell in on us
'Cause there was no land of promise
Lord it's a struggle just keepin' sight of who you are Oh, and these northern nights are dreary
My old southern heart is weary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I know that they all love me
And I know they're thinking of me
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong You know I've been thinkin' just a whole lot lately
About what's been and what awaits me
It takes all I've got to give what life demands
Lord, you go insane if you give in to it
Life's a mill and I've been through it
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands Oh, and these northern nights they're dreary
These old southern eyes are teary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus
I know He'll love and guide and lead us
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong If I'll keep looking to the Father
He'll keep my heads above the water
While the Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong
My home sweet home I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time
But that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you I thought I'd stay single always be free
But that was before I met you
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me
But that was before I met you I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you That was before I met you An old man was sitting at his table one day
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh, what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I'm coming to see her real soon I hope
He chocked back a big lump that rouse in his throat He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To god up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining, her little face pale
She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out Never looked either way
A big object hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last
The postman was passing
And picked up the note
Addressed to the master
And these words he spoke
Strait up into heave this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know (Dolly Parton) Hello you said the day we met
Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out
And to your surprise
And to mine I said I'd go
I thought it so romantic
And I found you sweet and bold
Though we'd only met
I still said yes
To a single yellow rose And for years to come
You were the one
To sleep with me at night
To laugh and talk
And share my thoughts
And hold me when I'd cry
And on every occasion
And for no good reason to
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
Was sent from you Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so I never see a yellow rose
That I didn't think of you
It's still my favorite flower
Though the yellow's turned to blue
The day you left my teardrops fell
Upon your farewell not
You said goodbye like you said hello
With a single yellow rose Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
Oh I still love you so Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Sweet yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down they're not aware that I'm around
Here I am crying my heart out, feeling sorry
But they're having a party just two doors down I think I'll dry these useless tears and get myself together
I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around
'Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever
I think I'd really rather join 'em two doors down Two doors down we're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down they're all aware that I'm around
Here I am no longer crying and feeling sorry
We're having a party just two doors down I can't believe I'm standing here dry-eyed, all smiles & talkin'
Making conversation with the new love I've found
I ask him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin'
Down the hall to my place waiting two doors down,yeah Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
'Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
'Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
Here I end feeling everything but sorry (Dolly Parton) Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear me, are you listenin' any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help me like before?
I have questioned your existence,
My resistance leaves me cold
Can you help me go the distance?
Hello God, hello, hello This old world has gone to pieces
Can we fix it, is there time?
Hate and violence just increases
We're so selfish, cruel and blind
We fight and kill each other
In your name, defending you
Do you love some more than others?
We're so lost and confused Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear us, are you listenin' any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help us like before?
Oh, the free will you have given
We have made a mockery of
This is no way to be livin',
We're in great need of your love
Hello God Hello God, can you grant us
Love enough to make amends
(Hello God) Is there still a chance
That we could start again
Hello God, we've learned our lesson
Dear God, don't let us go
More than ever
Hello God, hello, hello
Hello God, we really need you
We can't make it without you
(Hello God) We beseech you
In the name of all that's true
Hello God, please forgive us
For we know not what we do Hello God, give us one more chance to prove ourselves to you
Hello, God; hello, God Nobody believes that I really care for you
They don't think my heart is true
I don't think you agree
You know I'm a lifetime gaurantee So if they ask you what you mean to me
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go on and tell 'em baby Nobody believes we got somethin' they ain't got
They've never seen a fire this hot
They never got that far
We're burning as bright as any star
So if they ask you what your feelings are Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go ahead and tell 'em baby Feels so good, holding tight
Loving you through the night
Oh and they can call it what they like
But they ain't got it right
No, no, no Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
Oooo... Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything Oh, oh, oh
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough I am a seeker, a poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker, you are a teacher
You are a reacher, so reach down Won't you reach out and lead me
Guide me and keep me
In the shelter of your care each day
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
You are the leader, won't you show me the way? I am a vessel that's empty and useless
I am a bad seed that fell by the way
I am a loser that wants to be a winner
And you are my last hope
Don't turn me away I am a seeker, a poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker, you are a teacher
You are a reacher, so reach down Won't you reach out and lead me
Guide me and keep me, Lord
In the shelter of your care each day
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
You are the leader, won't you show me the way? Oh, I know you are a mountain
From which there flows a fountain
So let it's water wash my sins away
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
You are the leader, won't you show me the way? Happy, happy birthday baby
Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day
Would find me beside you
Happy, happy birthday baby
No, I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met
On a day I can't forget
Cause that's when we fell in love Do you remember
The names we had for each other
I was your pretty
You were my baby
Oh, how could we say goodbye Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I'm not acting like a lady
So I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too
Happy happy birthday baby (Dolly Parton) Well I met a boy from Grassy Branch
Fine as he can be
I met him at the big barn dance
And he took a shine to me
Sky-blue eyes, a big wide smile
And tall as a sycamore tree
He's real smart with a real big heart
And he's gonna marry me
He's gonna marry me
And we're gonna go to town
We're gonna buy some real good car
And we're gonna drive around
We'll hold hands an' touch 'n' hug
He talks so sweet to me
Cause he knows a lot about love and stuff
And he's gonna marry me His momma don't like me one little bit
But you know I don't care
Let her pitch her hissy-fit
Cause I ain't a'marryin' her
He's always been a momma's boy
It's just plain jealousy
She's as mad as an old wet hen
Cause he's gonna marry me Oh, an' he's gonna marry me
An' he's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he done kiss me on the mouth
An' he's gonna marry me Yeah, he's gonna marry me
He's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he's done kiss me on the mouth
So he's gotta marry me
Yeah he's done kiss me on the mouth
And he's gonna marry me Yodel-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at every sound
Half in hope of sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breakin' through
To drag us all away
And just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers' feet But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told me where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us know where
The stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there We both ran towards the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell Oh something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Then I saw Him die Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choices
I denied I knew His name
And even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same But suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
And I fell down on my knees
And I just clung to Him and cried Then He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt in my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace He's alive yes He's alive
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive yes He's alive
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive
Hallelujah He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive He's alive
I believe it He's alive
Sweet Jesus New York City ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at you funny, they take it wrong
The greenest state in the land of the free
And the home of the Grand Ole Opry
Is calling me back to my Smoky Mountain home I wish I had my old fishin' pole
And was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole
Eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite
Life ain't as simple as it used to be
Just since the big apple took a bite out of me
And Lord, I'm so Tennessee homesick that I could die But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
What I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste
Of Mama's homemade chocolate cake
Tennessee homesick blues is running through my head Mama you can fluff my feather bed
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head
Back to the Tennessee hills and it better be soon
Daddy you can load the rifles up
We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck
And head up to Calhoun Country and catch us a coon But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Eatin' grits and gravy and country ham
Go to church on Sunday with dinner on the grounds
Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head And I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Good Lord, have mercy on a country girl
Tryin' to make a living in a rhinestone world
It's hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world
With Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
I've got those Tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head
Tennessee homesick blues I remember the time when the bloom was on the cotton
When our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings
Winter cares which we're already few or soon forgotten
Just sittin' on the front porch swing Oh we sit every Sunday and watched the married ladies
And we dreamed of white dresses and church bells in the spring
And they talked and painted their nails while they let us hold their babies
Sittin' on the front porch swing Where was I when the time came to join the married ladies
Why did I paint the nail when the finger had no ring
Why do I sit at night at my age to hold their baby
Sittin' on the front porch swing When the mind longs to follow but the memory erases
And the lips form the words that the heart no longer sings
When the leaves in the hollow have been died to match our faces
Sittin' on the front porch swing Oh we'll dream of the time when the bloom was on the cotton
When our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings
But the words to the rhyme are the only things forgotten
Sittin' on the front porch swing
Sittin' on the front porch swing People always comin' up to me and askin'
"Dolly, what's your secret?
With all you do, your attitude
Just seems to be so good
How do you keep it?"
Well, I'm not the Dalai Lama, but I'll try
To offer up a few words of advice. Chorus:
You better get to livin', givin'
Don't forget to throw in a little forgivin'
And lovin' on the way
You better get to knowin', showin'
A little bit more concerned about where you're goin'
Just a word unto the wise
You better get to livin'. A girlfriend came to my house
Started cryin' on my shoulder Sunday evening
She was spinnin' such a sad tale
I could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'
So negative the words she had to say
I said if I had a violin I'd play. I said you'd better get to livin', givin'
Be willing and forgivin'
Cause all healing has to start with you
You better stop whining, pining
Get your dreams in line
And then just shine, design, refine
Until they come true
And you better get to livin'. Your life's a wreck, your house is mess
And your wardrobe way outdated
All your plans just keep on falling through
Overweight and under paid, under appreciated
I'm no guru, but I'll tell you
This I know is true. You better get to livin', givin'
A little more thought about bein'
A little more willin' to make a better way
Don't sweat the small stuff
Keep your chin up
Just hang tough
And if it gets too rough
Fall on your knees and pray
And do that everyday
Then you'll get to livin'. The day we're born we start to die
Don't waste one minute of this life
Get to livin'
Share your dreams and share your laughter
Make some points for the great hereafter. Better start carin'
Better start sharin'
Better start tryin'
Better start smiling
And you better get to livin'... (Dolly Parton) Say forever you'll be mine
Forever is the love that is filled with understanding
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine Trouble clouds may fill our skies
It might even rain awhile
But the rain will go away
There's always a brighter day Darling, I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Say forever you'll be mine, forever I am yours
And I'll do anything that you ever ask me to
And I'll do what you want me to Darling, I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine (Dolly Parton) Late one cold and stormy night I heard a dog a' barkin'
Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a' knockin'
I wondered who could be outdide in such an awful storm
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
Before I could say a word she said, 'My name is Sandy
And this here is my puppy dog, it's name is little Andy'
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little Andy
Patty cake and bakersman
My mommy ran away again
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill
Can we stay all night
If you don't love us no one will
I promise we won't cry
London bridge is fallin' down
My daddy's drunk again in town
And we was all alone and didn't what we could do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven
But that night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little (whispers) Andy (Dolly Parton) Hello, are you free tonight
I like your looks, I love your smile
Could I use you for a while,
It's all wrong, but it's all right The amber sunset glow has died
My needs are very much alive
Is it ok if I stop by
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and hold me tight
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right It may be wrong if we make love
But I just need someone so much
And who knows it might last for life
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and hold me tight
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and fantasize
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and hold me tight
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right

Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right Oooh,OOh,Oooh-ooh,Oh,Oh,Oh,Oh-oh-oh-oh.
Well, I can't tell you where I'm going
I'm not sure of where I've been
But I know I must keep travelin'
Till my road comes to an end I'm out here on my journey
Trying to make the most of it

Where all my pieces fit Chorus Like a poor wayfairing stranger

You're gonna see a change in me God made me for a reason
And nothing is in vain
Redemption comes in many shapes
With many kinds of pain Oh, sweet Jesus if you're out there
Keep me ever close to you

And it's hard to travelin' on
But hold in to each other
We don't have to work alone
When everything is broken
We can mend it if we try
We can make the world a difference
If we want to we can fllly.
Good-bye you little children
Good-night you handsome men
Farewell to all you ladies
And to all who knew me when...
And I hope I'll see ya down the road
You meant more than I knew

Redemption comes in many shapes with many kinds of pain
Oh sweet Jesus if you're listening, keep me ever close to you
As I'm stumblin', tumblin', wonderin', as I'm travelin' thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru Oh sometimes the road is rugged, and it's hard to travel on
But holdin' to each other, we don't have to walk alone
When everything is broken, we can mend it if we try
We can make a world of difference, if we want to we can fly Goodbye little children, goodnight you handsome men
Farewell to all you ladies and to all who knew me when
And I hope I'll see you down the road, you meant more than I knew
As I was travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin' thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin'
Drifting like a floating boat and roaming like the wind
Oh give me some direction lord, let me lean on you
As I'm travelin', travelin', travelin', thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru Like the poor wayfaring stranger that they speak about in song
I'm just a weary pilgrim trying to find my own way home
Oh sweet Jesus if you're out there, keep me ever close to you
As I'm travelin', travelin', travelin', as I'm travelin' thru Momma moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn't put mommy and daddy back together again Starting over again
Where should they begin
Cause they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And the whole world cries Got an apartment
She moved in with her sisters
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home
Just sorting out pieces
Of left over memories
From thirty odd years Starting over again
Where do you begin
You've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end What will the neighbors say?
They're talking talk, it's small town news
Facing fifty years old
Making up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools Starting over again
Now where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Could never put mommy and daddy back together
Back together, again (Dolly Parton) Chorus:
Love is pretty when love is new
Like a blushing rose in a dazzling dew,
Intoxicating like cherry sweet wine.
When love is new it's magic. Verse 1: Mother, oh Mother, why can't you see
He's the only love for me.
Why must thou be opposed to me
I'm asking for thy blessing. Daughter, oh daughter, I know his kind.
You think he's handsome, you think he's fine.
He'll use your body and tangle your mind;
Too late you'll learn this lesson Repeat Chorus When love grows cold, it's tragic Verse 2: Mother, oh mother, he's not that way
His touch just takes my breath away.
You surely remember when you felt that way
When you and father first married Oh, yes, I do remember it well.
What first was heaven soon turned to hell
He left with another the year you were born.
I told you he's dead and buried. Repeat Chorus Bridge: He'll love me true 'cause he told me so.
He'll break you heart when love grows old.
I must go, Mother, I must go.
Then, daughter, why are you asking?
I love him so, I love him so.
Then I pray you're new love's lasting. Repeat Chorus Tag: When love grows cold, it's tragic. 
Living on free food tickets. Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
where the rain came through, what can we do? Mmm.
Tears from your baby sister, crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go, oh but you know she'll get by,
Because she's living in the love of the common people, smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can.

It's a good thing you don't have bus-fare, it would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground, walking to the town to find a job.
Trying to keep your hands warm, but the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
and it chills to the bone. Boy you better go home where it's warm.
And you can live in the love of the common people, smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can.

Living on dreams ain't easy, but the closer the knit, the tighter the fit
and the chills stay away, you take them in stride, family pride.
You know, faith is your foundation, with a whole lot of love
and a warm conversation and many a prayer, making you strong where you belong.
Living in the love of the common people, smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can.
Living in the love of the common people, smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can, and she can.
Do you remember days not so very long ago, when the world was run by people twice your size?
And the days were full of laughter and the nights were full of stars,
and when you grew tired you could close your eyes.
Yes, the stars were there for wishing and the wind was there for kites,
and the morning sun was there for rise and shine.
And even if the sniffles kept you home from school in bed,
you couldn't hardly stay there after nine
And I wonder if the smell of morning's faded,
what happened to the robin's song that sparkled in the sky?
Where's all the water gone that tumbled down the stream? Will I ever catch another butterfly?

Do you remember campouts right in your own backyard wondering how airplanes could fly?
And the hours spent just playing with a funny rock you found
with crystal specks as blue as all the sky.
And I wonder if the smell of morning's faded,
what happened to the robin's song that sparkled in the sky?
Where's all the water gone that tumbled down the stream? Will I ever catch another butterfly?

Now I watch my son, he's playing with his toys, he's happy, I give him all I can.
But I can't help feeling just a little tingly inside when I hear him say he wants to be a man.
And I wonder if the smell of morning's faded,
what happened to the robin's song that sparkled in the sky?
Where's all the water gone that tumbled down the stream? Will I ever catch another butterfly?
Yes, I been dreaming about you every day, each and every day.
And I been thinking about all night long, I even wrote a song.
Just to try and tell you how I really feel, to make you understand my love is real,
that you're on my mind all the time, I wish to God you were mine once again.

I remember talking to you, I remember walking with you,
I remember laughing all the time when you were mine.
Now the days seem so long, I can't face the night alone,
I beg you please, won't you please come home.

I remember talking to you, I remember walking with you,
I remember laughing all the time when you were mine.
Now the days seem so long, I can't face the night alone,
I beg you please, won't you please come home.
If I look like home to you, if I am your sign, don't try to understand it girl when I draw the line.
It hasn't come to this that you can say I waste my time, looking everywhere, going nowhere.

For the skies, they look so lazy now, heavy are the clouds.
There's nothing here that I can learn of what it's all about.
You haven't said a thing to me, you talk so very loud, looking everywhere, going nowhere.

Well, I think I'll try the circus or go back to Mexico.
It's time to make mistakes again, it's time to change the show.
It's time and time and time again to find another way,
It's time to gather forces and get out of yesterday.
Because I lost what I was looking for, there's nothing left to share.
I need to take myself away to be some other where,
a face, a life, a minute more, I don't think I can spare, looking everywhere, going nowhere.

'Cause I tell you when you hurt me and you just don't seem to know,
I inform you when I'm lonely and you still don't think I'll go.
So if I lie to you and smile a thought that's only halfway here,
it's just a circus and I'm singing, I'm never really near.
If I look like home to you, if I am your sign, don't try to understand it girl when I draw the line.
It hasn't come to this that you can say I waste my time,
looking everywhere, looking everywhere, looking anywhere, going nowhere.
When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now.
Will you still be sending me a valentine,
Birthday greetings bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three, would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?

You'll be older too. And it you say the word, I would stay with you.
I could be handy, mending a fuse when your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage,
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear. We shall scrimp and save.
Grandchildren on your knee: Vera, Chuck & Dave.

Send me a postcard, drop me a line, stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say,
yours sincerely, wasting away.
Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forevermore.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?

So you speak to me of sadness and the coming of the winter,
The fear that is within you now that seems to never end,
and the dreams that have escaped you and the hope that you've forgotten,
and you tell me that you need me now and you want to be my friend,
and you wonder where we're going, where's the rhyme and where's the reason?
And it's you cannot accept: it is here we must begin to seek the wisdom of the children
and the graceful way of flowers in the wind.
For the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers,
their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day.
Like the music of the mountains and the colors of the rainbow,
they're a promise of the future and a blessing for today.

Though the cities start to crumble and the towers fall around us,
the sun is slowly fading and it's colder than the sea.
It is written: From the desert to the mountains they shall lead us,
by the hand and by the heart, they will comfort you and me.
In their innocence and trusting they will teach us to be free.
For the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers,
their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day.
And the song that I am singing is a prayer to non-believers,
come and stand beside us we can find a better way.
It's late December and the New Year's never coming,
time passes slowly in a two-room walk-up flat,
The sun is silent, there's a cold rain's gonna come on, no one to talk to but my lady's yellow cat.

Raindrops falling on the flowers in the window box, plastic roses that I planted yesterday.
I didn't think they'd die so soon but they're all withered now,
seems like everything I touch turns out that way.

Well, I guess I'll just go walking, the cat's no good for talking to,
He don't know what I'm saying and the rain is always playing on my mind, on my mind.

Street lights drifting through the blinds that cover window-panes
blending softy with the bare lights overhead.
Then together they run swiftly through my memory,
an eerie image of a strange and empty bed.

The wind is whipping up the papers in the street below,
I got some books to read but it seems they've all been read.
Clouds are crowded in a misty drifting sky above,
And I wish to hell I could remember what I said.

Well, I guess I'll just go walking, the cat's no good for talking to,
He don't know what I'm saying and the rain is always playing on my mind, on my mind.

One crystal wineglass on a table filled with scarlet stains
stands alone and empty where there once were two.
The jug is silent on the table by a broken plate,
the wine is gone, my lady, and so, my love, are you.

Well, I guess I'll just go walking, the cat's no good for talking to,
He don't know what I'm saying and the rain is always playing on my mind, on my mind
Isabel is waiting
In a room of many shadows
Her eyes like flashing diamonds
Shining brightly from the sea
Her hair in silken tresses
Like a robe around her shoulders
Hiding tantalising treasures
That the sun has never seen

Isabel is watching
Like a princess from the mountains
For the first soft snows of winter
And the icy winds they bring
With a whisper of her sadness
In the passing of the summer
Her crown is wild red roses
With a lace of forest green

And she wraps her arms around me and she sighs
And she sing to me in silence with her eyes
And her hair upon my pillow comforts me

Isabel is weeping
And her eyes are full of wonder
She knows that it's the time for her
And she cannot understand
She's a mistress of the moonlight
To the stars she is a sister
And the morning now awaits her
To betray her once again

And she whispers as she sadly slips away
Then she smiles because there's nothing left to say
And she takes with her the sadness and the sun
I told you that I loved you, you said that is so good.
I called you my darling, I thought I always would.
But now you've gone and left me, I don't know what to do.
So my little darling, I write these words to you.

You dun stomped on my heart and you mashed that sucker flat.
You just sorta stomped on my aorta.
You started going out with guys. I felt us drift apart.
And every step you took was a stomp on my heart.

I only hope that someday, you get them low down blues.
In some smoky honky-tonk you'll look down at your shoes.
You'll think about that tender heart that you crushed beneath them soles.
With your cold busting stompers, you left my heart so full of holes.

You dun stomped on my heart and you mashed that sucker flat.
You just sorta stomped on my aorta.
You started going out with guys. I felt us drift apart.
And every step you took was a stomp on my heart.
And every step you took was a stomp on my heart.

My old man had a rounder's soul, he'd hear an old freight train, then he'd have to go.
Said he'd been blessed with the gypsy bone,
that's the reason they guessed he'd been cursed to roam.

Came into town back before the war, didn't even know what it was he was looking for.
He carried a tattered bag for his violin, it was full of lots of songs and places that he'd been.
He talked real easy, had a smiling way to pass along to you when his fiddle played.

Making people drop their cares and woes to hum out loud those tunes that his fiddle bowed.
Till the people there began to join that sound, and everyone in town was laughing,
singing, dancing round.
Like the fiddler's tune was all they heard that night,
as if some dream said, "All the world is right,"

His fiddler's eye caught one beauty there. She had that rolling, flowing, golden kind of hair.
He played for her as if she danced alone, he played his favorite songs, ones he called his own.
He played until she was the last to go, stopped and packed his case, said he'd take her home.
All the nights that passed a child was born.
All the years that passed, love would keep them warm.
All their lives they'd share a dream come true, all because she danced so well to his fiddle tune.

My old man had a rounder's soul, he'd hear an old freight train, then he'd have to go.
All that I recall he said when I was so young
was no one else could really sing those songs he sung.
And I wish I knew how
It would feel to be free
I wish that I could break
All the chains holding me
I wish I could say
All the things that I'd like to say
Say 'em loud say 'em clear
For the whole round world to hear
I wish I could share
All the love that's in my heart
Remove every doubt that keeps us apart
And I wish you could know
What it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree
Every man should be free

I wish I could live

Like I'm longin' to live
I wish I could give
What I'm longin' to give
And I wish I could do
All the things I'd like to do
You know they still are quite a few
Yes Sir...
And I'm way way over due

I wish I could be like a bird up in the sky
How sweet it would be
If I found out I could fly
So long to the sun
And look down upon Ihe sea
And I sing because I know
how it feels to be
And I sing because I know
how it feels to be
And I sing because I know
how it feels to be free
It's by far the hardest thing I've ever done, to be so in love with you and so alone.
Follow me where I go, what I do and who I know, make it part of you to be a part of me.
Follow me up and down, all the way and all around, take my hand and say you'll follow me.

It's long been on my mind, you know, it's been a long, long time.
I'll try to find the way that I can make you understand
the way I feel about you and just how much I need you
to be there where I can talk to you when there's no one else around.
Follow me where I go, what I do and who I know, make it part of you to be a part of me.
Follow me up and down, all the way and all around, take my hand and say you'll follow me.

You see, I'd like to share my life with you and show you things I've seen,
places that I'm going to and places where I've been.
To have you there beside me and never be alone,
and all the time that you're with me, then we will be at home.

Follow me where I go, what I do and who I know, make it part of you to be a part of me.
Follow me up and down, all the way and all around, take my hand and I will follow you.
Oh, lay me down in Forest Lawn in a silver casket
with golden flowers over my head in a silver basket.
Let the drum and bugle corp play taps while cannons roar.
While sixteen liveried employees sell souvenirs from the funeral store.
I wanna go simply when I go. They'll give me a simple funeral there, I know.
With a casket lined in fleece and the fireworks spelling out "Rest in Peace,"
Oh, take me when I'm gone to Forest Lawn.

Oh, lay me down in Forest Lawn, they understand there.
They have a heavenly choir in the military band there.
Just put me in their care, I'll find my comfort there.
With sixteen planes in a last salute, they'll drop a cross in a parachute.
I wanna go simply when I go, they'll give me a simple funeral there I know
With a hundred strolling strings and topless dancers with golden wings,
Oh, take me when I'm gone to Forest Lawn.

Oh, come, come, come, come, come to the church in the wild wood,
Kindly leave a contribution in the pail.
Be as simple and as trusting as a child would and we'll sell you the church in the dale.

To find a simple resting place is my desire.
To lay me down with a smiling face comes a little bit higher.
My likeness cast in brass will stand in plastic grass
While hidden weights and springs tips it's hat to the mourners filing past.

I wanna go simply when I go. They'll give me a simple funeral there I know.
I'll lie beneath the sand with piped-in tapes of Billy Graham,
oh, take me when I'm gone to forest lawn.

Rock of ages cleft for me for a slightly higher fee. Oh, take me when I'm gone to forest lawn.
See the sunlight through the pine, taste the warm of winter wine.
Dream of softly falling snow, winter skol, aspenglow.
As the winter days unfold, hearts grow warmer with the cold.
Peace of mind is all you know, winter skol, aspenglow.

Aspen is a life to live, see how much there is to give,
see how strongly you believe, see how much you may receive.

Smiling faces all around, laughter is the only sound,
memories that can't grow old, winter skol, aspenglow.

Aspen is a life to live, see how much there is to give,
see how strongly you believe, see how much you may receive.

See the sunlight through the pine, taste the warm of winter wine.
Dream of softly falling snow, winter skol, aspenglow.
As the winter days unfold, hearts grow warmer with the cold.
Peace of mind is all you know, winter skol, aspenglow. Winter skol, aspenglow.
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
of the dreams that he brings from the wide open seas.
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
while the riverbank weeps through the old willow trees.
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies full of beer,
full of cries in a drunken down fight.
In the port of Amsterdam, there a sailor who's born
on a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light.

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet,
there's a sailor who eats only fish heads and tails.
He will show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
that can swallow the moon, that can haul up the sail.
And he yells to the cook with his arms open wide, bring me more fish, put it down by my side.
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
so he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly.

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance,
haunchs bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch.
They've forgotten the tune that their whisky voice croaked,
and they're spitting the night with the roar of their jokes.
And they turn and they dance, and they laugh and they lust
to the rancid sound of the accordian's burst.
then it's out into the night with their pride in their pants
and a slut that they tow underneath the street lamps.

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who drinks.
and he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again.
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
who have promised their love to a thousand other men.
And they bargain their bodies and their virtue, long gone,
for a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on,
he plants his nose in the sky and we wipes it up above
then he splits like I cry for an unfaithful love,
in the port of Amsterdam, in the port of Amsterdam, in the port of Amsterdam.
See the sun rise, open up your eyes, today is the very first day.
Watch the morning come, now the night is gone, yesterday is so very far away.
Trouble, you get out of my sight, you know I can't look at you when the sun is so bright,
You know everything's coming together now, can't you see?
And I live my life in celebration that I've got a life to live,
and I sing my song in revelation that I've got a song that I can give to you, and you know I do.

La la la la la la la:

I was blind but, now I can see, you know, I'm just learning how it feels to be free,
you know I never really knew just what it could be before.
And I live my life in celebration that I've got a life to live,
and I sing my song in revelation that I've got a song that I can give to you,
and you know I do and you know it's true.

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la.
Sticky summer weather always pains me. It's like living beneath a blanket, I can't breathe.
The days are like an oven, the nights forever. Nothing to do, not much else to see.
Then again, I can't stand the thought of winter, ain't got a fire, there's nobody to keep me warm.
The night is gray, and my coffee tastes so bitter, my memories go raging like a storm.

Seems like twenty years ago it was springtime, the rain was sweet, the wind was cool and clean.
I had a girl, she was a lady I could talk to, now its almost like she'd never been.
I've been a long time looking for rainbows, trying to find a way to believe in tomorrow.

There was a time I think when I remember dreaming, there was a reason I can't find it now.
As I recall, it almost made my life worth living. It must be hiding like the sun behind the clouds.
I've been a long time looking for rainbows, trying to find a way to believe in tomorrow.

Sticky summer weather always pains me. It's like living beneath a blanket, I can't breathe.
The days are like an oven, the nights forever. Nothing to do, not much else to see.
I'm spending a long time looking for rainbows.
In my mind I'm going to Carolina. Can't you see the sunshine,
can't you just feel the moon shining?
Ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind and I'm going to Carolina in my mind.

Karen she's a silver sun, you best walk her way and watch it shine,
watch her watch the morning come.
A silver tear's appearing now, I'm crying, ain't I? I'm going to Carolina in my mind.

There ain't no doubt it no one's mind that loves the finest thing around,
whisper something soft and kind.
And hey, babe, the sky's on fire, I'm dying, ain't I? I'm going to Carolina in my mind.

In my mind I'm going to Carolina. Can't you see the sunshine,
can't you just feel the moon shining?
Ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind and I'm going to Carolina in my mind.

Dark and silent late last night, I think I might have heard the highway call.
Geese in flight and dogs that bite.
Signs that might be omens say I'm going. I'm going, I'm going to Carolina in my mind.

With a holy host of others standing round me, still I'm on the dark side of the moon.
and it seems like it goes on like this forever, you must forgive me if it's up and

In my mind I'm going to Carolina. Can't you see the sunshine,
can't you just feel the moon shining?
Ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind and I'm going to Carolina in my mind,
in my mind I'm going to Carolina.
Can't you see the sunshine, can't you just feel the moon shining?
Ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind and I'm going to Carolina in my mind
Ah, look at all the lonely people. Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been, lives in a dream.
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door. Who is it for?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear, no one comes near.
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there,
what does he care?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people. Ah, look at all the lonely people.

Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name, nobody came.
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave, no one was saved.
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all the lonely people. Ah, look at all the lonely people.
I saw you walking by his side heard you whisper all those lies
And I couldn't keep from crying
You sang him love songs tenderly that should have been for you and me
And I couldn't keep from crying
I saw his eyes drinking your charms while he held you in his arms
Him with all his wedding ways rules your heart now in my place
I stood and watched him steal a kiss from two lips I know I'll miss
And I couldn't keep from crying I saw his eyes drinking your charms... I love that hair, long an' black
Hangin' down to the middle of your back
Don't cut it off whatever you do
I need it to run my fingers through 'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby Got me a dollar that I saved
Saved it up for a rainy day
Everybody's callin' for bills that's due
But they don't catch me, I'll spend it on you 'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby Got me a guitar, got a six strings
And a picker to make 'em ring
Every string's gotta know what to do
'Cause I'm gonna use 'em to serenade you 'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my baby Well, I had me a gal, she said she's mine
But she run around on me all the time
Now she's gone an' I'm glad we're through
'Cause I'm plum-flipped over you 'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby Oh, baby, baby, yeah you're my baby
Well, I don't mean maybe
You drive me crazy
I love you, baby, you're my, babydoll Love is a burnin' thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
The ring of fire I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine
Since, I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone When I was just a baby
My Mama told me, son
Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry I bet there's rich folks eatin'
In a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigars
But I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move out over a little
Farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow my blues away Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playing with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
Somewhere, somehow along the way On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyons
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later God'll cut you down
Sooner or later God'll cut you down Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler,
The gambler,
The back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, "John go do My will!" Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler,
The gambler,
The back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later God'll cut you down
Sooner or later God'll cut you down Well you may throw your rock and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's down in the dark will be brought to the light You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later God'll cut you down
Sooner or later God'll cut you down Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler,
The gambler,
The back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and I cried You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me and love another
You'll regret it all some day You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But now you've left me and love another
You have shattered all of my dreams You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
When I awake my poor heart pains
So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout,
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out.
I'm goin' to Jackson, I'm gonna mess around,
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson,
Look out Jackson town. Well, go on down to Jackson; go ahead and wreck your health.
Go play your hand you big-talkin' man, make a big fool of yourself,
Yeah, go to Jackson; go comb your hair!
Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson.
See if I care. When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow. (Hah!)
All them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how,
I'm goin' to Jackson, you turn-a loose-a my coat.
'Cause I'm goin' to Jackson.
"Goodbye," that's all she wrote. But they'll laugh at you in Jackson, and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg.
They'll lead you 'round town like a scalded hound,
With your tail tucked between your legs,
Yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man.
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson, behind my Jaypan Fan, Well now, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper Sprout,
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went.
I'm goin' to Jackson, and that's a fact.
Yeah, we're goin' to Jackson, ain't never comin' back. Well, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout'
And we've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went... I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds.
Because you're mine, I walk the line. I find it very, very easy to be true.
I find myself alone when each day is through.
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you.
Because you're mine, I walk the line. As sure as night is dark and day is light.
I keep you on my mind both day and night.
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line. You've got a way to keep me on your side.
You give me cause for love that I can't hide.
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide.
Because you're mine, I walk the line. My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died Some glad morning when this life is o'er,
I'll fly away.
To that home on God's celestial shore,
I'll fly away. I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away.
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,
I'll fly away.
Just a few more weary days and then,
I'll fly away. To that land where joy will never end,
I'll fly away.
I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away.
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,
I'll fly away. Oh I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away in the morning
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,
I'll fly away. Well, you wonder why I always dress in black,
Why you never see bright colors on my back,
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on. I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,
But is there because he's a victim of the times. I wear the black for those who never read,
Or listened to the words that Jesus said,
About the road to happiness through love and charity,
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me. Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black. I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men. And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,
Believen' that the Lord was on their side,
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
Believen' that we all were on their side. Well, there's things that never will be right I know,
And things need changin' everywhere you go,
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,
You'll never see me wear a suit of white. Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,
And tell the world that everything's OK,
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,
'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head. Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico. Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down. I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more. When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail. Early next morning about a half past nine
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about. In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
It's you, It's you, must go, and I must bide But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so But if you come, and all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me And I will know, tho' soft ye tread above me
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me
And I will rest in peace until you come to me There's a land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see it apart
For the father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place there
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore We shall meet on the beautiful shore
We shall sing on that beautiful shore for the melodious songs of the blessed
And our spirits shall sorrow no more not a sight for the blessing of rest
In the sweet by and by To a bountiful father above we shall offer our tribute of praise
For the glory as gift of his love and the blessing that howlered days
In the sweet by and by
In the sweet by and by If you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
Oh she once was a true love of mine See for me if her hair's hanging down
It curls and falls all down her breast
See for me that her hair's hanging down
That's the way I remember her best If you go when the snowflakes falls
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin' winds If you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Please say "hello" to the one who lives there
Oh she was once a true love of mine If you're travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
Oh she once was a true love of mine A true love of mine
A true love of mine
True love of mine
A true love of mine
A true love of mine
She was once a true love of mine I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry,
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die. I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota).
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
And I followed you, Big River, when you called. Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone. Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf.
She loves you, Big River, more than me. Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die. There ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
When I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna rise right out of the ground
Ain't no grave can hold my body down Well, look way down the river, what do you think I see?
I see a band of angels and they're coming after me
Ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down Well, look down yonder Gabriel, put your feet on the land and see
But Gabriel don't you blow your trumpet 'til you hear it from me
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
Ain't no grave can hold my body down Well, meet me Jesus, meet me. Meet me in the middle of the air
And if these wings don't fail me I will meet you anywhere
Ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down Well, meet me mother and father, meet me down the river road
And momma you know that I'll be there when I check in my load
Ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down
There ain't no grave can hold my body down I want to live,
I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old.
It keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old. I've been to Hollywood
I've been to redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old.
It keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old. You keep me searching for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
And I'm getting old. Well, I left Kentucky back in forty nine
An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black. One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand. I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around. So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years. The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home. Now, up to now my plan went all right
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong. The transmission was a fifty three
And the motor turned out to be a seventy three
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone. So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an adapter kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight' was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on. The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said "Honey, take me for a spin." So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds. I got it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around. Ugh! Yeah, RED RYDER
This is the COTTON MOUTH
In the PSYCHO-BILLY CADILLAC Come on Huh, This is the COTTON MOUTH
And negatory on the cost of this mow-chine there RED RYDER
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Ugh!, what model is it? Well, It's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56
'57, '58' 59' automobile
It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67
'68, '69, '70 automobile. Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife Did I hear someone applaud? Now the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night, when the north wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me Can I have a glass of water?
huh? Alright
Lemme have a, have a drink of water. I'm about to choke up
That's cocaine blues.
We got a special surprise for, you fellas
And especially for one fella.
In a few minutes we're going to record a brand new song that
I just sang last night for the first time
It was written by someone here in Folsom prison
Can I have a drink of water?
Last time, last time I was here I had a drink of water
And uh, I don't know what the hell it run off
I think it must have run off Luther's boots or something
Is that water?
You promise that's water, huh
Is that water bob?
That's water
Serve everything in tin cups?
He caught it, didn't he?
I have an announcement here
Sandoval, Sandoval, S-A-N-D-O-V-A-L. Sandoval
Eighty eight four one nine is wanted in reception I asked my love to take a walk
Take a walk just a little ways
And as we walked, along we talk
All would be our wedding day And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio I plunged a knife into her breast
And told her she was going to rest
She cried "Oh Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity" I took her by her golden curls
And drug her down to the river side
And there I threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio And going home between twelve and one
I cried "Oh Lord, what have I've done?"
I've killed the only girl I love
Because she would not marry me And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio Well my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to Ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me "Sue" Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named "Sue" Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
Roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made me a vow to the moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me "Sue" Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: "My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!?
Now you gonna die!"
Yeah that's what I told 'em Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile And he said, "Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong" Yeah he said, "Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you "Sue"
Yeah what could I do, what could I do I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
Called him my Pa, and he called me his son
And I come away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name! Yeah I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses
And he walks with me
And he talks with me [Chorus]
And he tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me
And he talks with me [Chorus] I'd stay in the garden with Him
'Tho the night around me be falling
But He bids me go, through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling
And He walks with me
And He talks with me [Chorus] Come all you rounders if you want to hear the story about a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the roller's name on a 68 wheeler course he won his fame
Caller called Casey bout half past four he kissed his wife at the station door
He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said this is the trip to the Promised Land
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leanin' out the window taking a trip to the Promised Land Through South Memphis Yards on a fly rain been a fallin' and the water was high
Everybody knew by the engine's moan that the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
Well Jones said fireman now don't you fret Sam Webb said we ain't a givin' up yet
We're eight hours late with the southbound mail
We'll be on time or we're leavin' the rails
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin Dead on the rail was a passenger train blood was a boilin' in Casey's brain
Casey said hey now look out ahead jump Sam jump or we'll all be dead
With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake north Mississippi was wide awake
I see railroad official said he's a good engineer to be a laying dead
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin Headaches and heartaches and all kinds of pain all the part of a railroad train
Sweat and toil the good and the grand part of the life of a railroad man
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby? If you were a carpenter
And I were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby If a tinker was my trade
Would I still find you
I'd be carrying the pots you made
Following behind you
Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onlyness
Give me your tomorrow If I were a miller
And a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your colored blouse
And your soft shoes shining? If you were a miller
And a mill wheel grinding
I'd not miss my colored blouse
And my soft shoes shining Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onlyness
Give me your tomorrow If I worked my hands on wood
Would you still love me?
I'd answer you yes I would
And would you not be above me? If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby Save your love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onlyness
Give me your tomorrow Why me Lord
What have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the blessings I've known
Why me Lord
What did I ever do
That was worth love from you
And the kindness you've shown Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so
Help me, Jesus
I know what I am
Now that I know
That I've needed you so
Help me, Jesus
My soul's in your hand Try me Lord
If you think there's a way
That I can repay
What I've taken from you
Maybe Lord
I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you Lord help me, Jesus
I've wasted it so
Help me, Jesus
I know what I am
Now that I know
That I've needed you so
Help me, Jesus
My soul's in your hand
Jesus
My soul's in your hand Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you now
If you've got someone to blame You said one love
One life
When it's one need
In the night
One love we get to share it
It leaves you baby if you don't care for it Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without Well it's too late
Tonight
To drag the past out
Into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head? Did I ask too much?
More than a lot?
You gave me nothing now
It's all I've got
We're one but we're not the same
Well we hurt each other and we're doing it again You said love is a temple
Love the higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law You ask me to enter
But then you make me crawl
I can't be holding on
To what you've got
When all you've got is hurt One love
One blood
One life
You've got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sister
Brothers
One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One
One
One
One Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door But it ain't me babe
No, no, no, it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more But it ain't me babe
No, no, no, it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe You say you're lookin' for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothin' more But it ain't me babe
No, no, no, it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get goin'
Get rhythm, when you get the blues Little shoeshine boy never get slowed down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of a dirty street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said. Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind,
Get rhythm, when you get the blues. Get rhythm, when you get the blues
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get goin'
Get rhythm, when you get the blues. Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump with joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a poppin' and he said again Get rhythm, when you get the blues
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
It only cost a dime, just a nickel a shoe
It does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm, when you get the blues I was on my way to you and I was worried
I was all torn up and nervous 'cause I knew that you'd be gone
I knocked and crossed my fingers while I waited
And I couldn't hold the teardrops when I walked away alone It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed (it's all over)
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, so forget her (it's all over)
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go I was runnin' 'round in circles like a baby
I was in a daze because I loved you so, I couldn't see
I was broken in a million little pieces
When I saw enough to realize, you didn't care for me It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed, it's all over
Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
It's all over, it's all over, so forget her (it's all over)
Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
Oh were you there when they crucified my Lord?
(Ohh, sometimes it causes me to tremble)
Tremble
Were you there when they crucified my Lord? Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross?
Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross?
(Ohh, sometimes it causes me to tremble)
Tremble
Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross? Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
(Ohh, sometimes it causes me to tremble)
Tremble
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb? Well, were you there when the stone was rolled away?
Were you there when the stone was rolled away?
(Ohh, sometimes it causes me to tremble)
Tremble
Were you there when the stone was rolled away? Just as I am without one plea but that
Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee
Oh lamb of God I come I come Just as I am and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot
To Thee who's blood can cleanse each spot
Oh lamb of God I come I come Just as I am Lord Thou tossed about
With many a conflict and many a doubt
Fightings fears within and without
Oh lamb of God I come I come Just as I am Thou wilt receive
Will dwell come pardon cleanse relieve
Because Thy promise I believe
Oh lamb of God I come I come Well lordy I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's growin' in the meadow (down by the water)
I shall not be moved I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved
On my way to glory land I will not be moved
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved [Chorus: x2]
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved Well I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved
On my way to glory land I shall not be moved
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved Oh well
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved [Chorus] Glory, glory, glory hallelujah, I shall not be moved
Glory hallelujah, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved Well, now I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Comin' for to carry me home
There was a band of angels a comin' after me
Comin' for to carry me home Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home Well, I'm sometimes up and I'm sometimes down
Comin' for to carry me home
But I know my soul is heavenly bound
Comin' for to carry me home Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home Well, now if you get there before I do
Comin' for to carry me home
Tell all of my friends that I'm a comin' too
Comin' for to carry me home Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Well, now they're comin' for to carry me home I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine
Since, I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San Antone When I was just a baby
My Mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy
Don't ever play with guns" But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry I bet there's rich folks eatin'
From a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee
And smokin' big cigars Well, I know I had it comin'
I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it all a little
Farther down the line Far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow my blues away "And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder
One of the four beasts saying,
'Come and see.' and I saw, and behold a white horse" There's a man goin' 'round takin' names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reachin' down
When the man comes around The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground?
When the man comes around Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singin'
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
Voices callin', voices cryin'
Some are born and some are dyin'
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks Till armageddon no shalam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singin'
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
Voices callin', voices cryin'
Some are born and some are dyin'
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn trees
It's hard for thee to kick against the prick
In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around "And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts
And I looked, and behold a pale horse
And his name that sat on him was death, and hell followed with him" Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed
Where the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold
Where the miles are marked in the blood and gold
I'll meet you further on up the road Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring
My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing
I got a song to sing, keep me out of the cold
And I'll meet you further on up the road. Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Where the way dark and the night is cold
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road. Now I been out in the desert, just doin' my time
Searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign
If there's a light up ahead well brother I don't know
But I got this fever burnin' in my soul
So let's take the good times as they go
And I'll meet you further on up the road Further on up the road [Repeat: x4] One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road. I saw her through the window today
She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon cafe
I started to keep going
But something made me stop
She used to love me a lot She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in
And I give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said where have you been it's been awhile
She was glad to see me
I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said good-bye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot I remember how good it was back then
And I said it's not to late to start again
We could spend a night together
Take up where we left off
She used to love me a lot But I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
Yes I'm in need of something
But it's something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said good-bye
She just left me standing there, I never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot, she used to love me a lot, she used to love me a lot I have found a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
He's the Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay
And He tells me every care on Him to roll
He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul He will never, never leave me nor yet forsake me here
While I live by faith and do His blessed will
There's a wall of fire about me and I've nothing now to fear
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill And then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll
He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
'Til we gather in Heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore If we never meet again this side of Heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in Heaven
By the beautiful river of life Where the charming roses bloom forever
separation comes no more
If we never meet again this side of Heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore All they say we shall meet by the river
Where no clouds ever darken the sky
And they say we'll be happy in Heaven
In that wonderful sweet by and by If we never meet again this side of Heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in Heaven
By the beautiful river of life Where the charming roses bloom forever
And separation comes no more
If we never meet again this side of Heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore I'm a charger that charges through the night,
Like an orange bolt of lightning passing everything in sight.
I'm the best pal that you boys ever had,
I'm thunder on the highway lookin' bad, bad, bad. I'm a knight, like the kind in shining armor,
With my polished body gleaming, I'm a fighter and a charmer.
If trouble comes your way just ask for me,
My friends all know me as General Lee. I'm the Gerneral Lee,
A pistol pumpin', steel belted cavalry.
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me;
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean.
Take a look back there:
Sirens blownin', red lights flashin' everywhere;
We'll cross the fields and we'll be running free,
They'll eat dust compliments of me: The General Lee I'm a hero, and that's how I'll make you feel
When you're riding shotgun with me and the law is at your heels.
I'm glory bound, but when the chase is done,
I'll take off through the mountains and have fun, fun, fun. I've got style, tearing through the curves;
Let my flag wave proudly to the people that I serve.
I'm number one, and I will always be
The pride of the South they call the General Lee. I'm the Gerneral Lee,
A pistol pumpin', steel belted cavalry.
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me;
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean.
Take a look back there:
Sirens blownin', red lights flashin' everywhere;
I'll jump that pond and we'll be running free,
And they'll go swimmin', compliments of me: The General Lee
The General Lee
General Lee I still miss someone
At my door the leaves are falling
The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
'Cause I still miss someone Oh, I never got over those blues eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone I still miss someone
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone I still miss someone Green, green, forty shades of green I close my eyes and picture
The emerald of the sea
From the fishing boats at Dingle
To the shores of Donaghadee I miss the river Shannon
And the folks at Skibbereen
The moorlands and the meddle
With their forty shades of green But most of all I miss a girl
In Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her lips
As soft as eiderdown Again I want to see and do
The things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
And there's forty shades of green Green, green, forty shades of green I wish that I could spend an hour
At Dublin's churching surf
I'd love to watch the farmers
Drain the bogs and spade the turf To see again the thatching
Of the straw the women glean
I'd walk from Cork to Larne to see
The forty shades of green But most of all I miss a girl
In Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her lips
As soft as eiderdown Again I want to see and do
The things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
And there's forty shades of green Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday I'm going down to the river
I'm going top take me a rocking chair
And if the blues don't leave me, I rock on away from here Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worth living, I feel like I could die Trouble in mind, I'm blue
My poor heart is healing slow
I've never had such trouble in my whole life before I'm gonna lay my head on some lonesome railroad line
And let that two-nineteen special ease my troubled mind Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday We're the best partners this world's ever seen,
Together as close as can be.
Sometimes it's hard to find time in between,
To tell you what you are to me. You are the rose of my heart,
You are the love of my life.
A flower not fading nor falling apart,
If you're tired, rest your head on my arm.
Rose of my heart. When sorrow holds you in her arms of clay,
It's rain drops that fall from your eyes.
Your smile's like the sun come to earth for a day,
You brighten my blackest of skies. You are the rose of my heart,
You are the love of my life.
A flower not fading nor falling apart,
If you're cold, let my love make you warm.
Rose of my heart. So hard times or easy times, what do I care,
There's nothing I'd change if I could.
The tears and the laughter are things that we share,
Your hand in mine makes all times good. You are the rose of my heart,
You are the love of my life.
A flower not fading nor falling apart,
You're my harbor in life's restless storm.Rose of my heart. Rose of my heart. I was toting my pack along the long dusty Winnemucca road
When along came a semi with a high canvas covered load
If your goin' to Winnemucca, Mack with me you can ride
And so I climbed into the cab and then I settled down inside
He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand

I've been everywhere I believe my steps are growin' wearier each day
Still I've got another journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me wanna stay
And my one regret is leavin' you behind But if it proves to be his will that I am first to go
And somehow I've a feelin' it will be
When it comes your time to travel likewise, don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters, reaching for your hand Through this life we've labored hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
So I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come, then we'll see paradise And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters, reaching for your hand I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with the shout
And come running through the shallow waters, reaching for your hand, hmm We sailed on the ship John B my grandfather and me around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night got into a fight well I feel so homesick I wanna go home So hoist up the John B sail see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore let me go home Let me go home why don't you let me go home
Well I feel so homesick I wanna go home The first mate he got drunk broke up the people's trunk
Constable had to come and take him away Sheriff John Stone why don't you leave me alone
Well I feel so homesick I wanna go home Then the cook he caught the fits threw out all of my grits
Then he took and ate up all of my corn Let me go home why don't you let me go home
Well this is the worst trip since I have been born So hoist up the John B sail. Drink to me only with thine eyes
And I will pledge with mine.
Or leave a kiss within the cup
And I'll not ask for wine.
The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine;
But might I of Jove's nectar sip,
I would not change for thine. I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
Not so much hon'ring thee
As giving it a hope that there
It could not withered be;
But thou thereon did'st only breathe,
And sent'st it back to me,
Since when it grows and smells, I swear
Not of itself, but thee. Drink to me only with thine eyes
And I will pledge with mine.
Or leave a kiss within the cup
And I'll not ask for wine.
The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine;
But might I of Jove's nectar sip,
I would not change for thine. I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench an old man was sitting there
I said, your old courthouse is kinda run down
He said, naw, it'll do for our little town
I said, your old flagpole has leaned a little bit
And that's a ragged old flag you got hanging on it He said, have a seat, and I sat down
Is this the first time you've been to our little town?
I said, I think it is
He said, I don't like to brag
But we're kinda proud of that ragged old flag You see, we got a little hole in that flag there when
Washington took it across the Delaware
And it got powder-burned the night Francis Scott Key
Sat watching it writing say can you see
And it got a bad rip in New Orleans
With Packingham and Jackson tuggin' at its seams And it almost fell at the Alamo
Beside the texas flag, but she waved on though
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
There was Robert E. Lee, Beauregard, and Bragg
And the south wind blew hard on that ragged old flag On Flanders field in World War one
She got a big hole from a Bertha gun
She turned blood red in World War Two
She hung limp and low a time or two
She was in Korea and Vietnam
She went where she was sent by Uncle Sam She waved from our ships upon the Briny foam
And now they've about quit waving her back here at home
In her own good land here she's been abused
She's been burned, dishonored, denied, and refused And the government for which she stands
Is scandalized throughout the land
And she's getting threadbare and wearing thin
But she's in good shape for the shape she's in
'Cause she's been through the fire before
And I believe she can take a whole lot more So we raise her up every morning
We take her down every night
We don't let her touch the ground and we fold her up right
On second thought, I do like to brag
'Cause I'm mighty proud of that ragged old flag I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world below
There is no sickness, no toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I go I'm going there to see my Father
And all my loved ones who've gone on
I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home I know dark clouds will gather 'round me
I know my way is hard and steep
But beauteous fields arise before me
Where God's redeemed, their vigils keep
I'm going there to see my Mother
She said she'd meet me when I come So, I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home
I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
I can't wait to get on the road again On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way, is on the road again Just cant wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way Is on the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again
And I cant wait to get on the road again I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around and around and around I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again Oh, come all you young fellers, young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
'Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double, pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine Well it's many a man, that I've seen in my day
(No laughing during the song please)
(It's been recorded I know, hell)
(Don't you know it's recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope,
And a dropper with his wine
A man will have less for the lure of the mine
And, I pray when I'm dead and the ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double and the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Sorry about that little interruption there, but I just
Want to tell you that this show is being recorded for an album
Release on Columbia Records and you can't say hell or shit or anything like that
How's that grab you Bob? There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there.
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blessed;
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
To our bountiful Father above,
We will offer our tribute of praise
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that hallow our days.
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore. About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war
I saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store, when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen So l asked if I could have one when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and i soon found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand Well I get into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
the devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand Don't call my name out your window, I'm leavin'
I won't even turn my head.
Don't sent your kinfolk to give me no talkin'
I'll be gone, like I said. You'd just say the same old thing
That you be sayin' all along,
Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut,
Till I'm gone.
Don't give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan Understand your man, I'm tired of your bad-mouthin'
Understand your man. You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army,
And everything else I leave behind
I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin'
While I'm untanglin' my mind. I ain't gonna repeat
What I said any more
While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before,
I'll be just as gone as the wild goose in winter Then you'll understand your man, meditate on it
Understand your man, you hear me talking
Understand your man. Remember what I told you
Understand your man
Understand your man On a Monday, I was arrested (uh huh)
On a Tuesday, they locked me in the jail (oh boy)
On a Wednesday, my trial was attested
On a Thursday, they said guilty and the Judge's gavel fell I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders

Non Album Tracks Tennessee Stud Jimmy Driftwood / Warden Music BMI (1994) Back about eighteen and twenty-five
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would have made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been a-riding on the Tennessee Stud I had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Thud
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud I drifted on down into no man's land
I crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with the Spaniards bold
'Til I got me a skinful of silver and gold Me and a gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We pulled our guns, he fell with a thud
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud I rode right back across Arkansas
And I whupped her brother and I whupped her pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
And she was a-riding on a Tennessee Mare Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
And a little horse colt playing 'round the door
I love the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare. The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
And there never was a horse like the Tennessee Stud Click here for correction service info.

And there ain't no good chain gang. I was born in Saginaw, Michigan
And I grew up in a house on Saginaw Bay
My daddy was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay I loved a girl in Saginaw, Michigan
She was the daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me, "That son of a Saginaw fisherman"
And not good enough to ever claim his daughter's hand That's why I'm up here in Alaska looking around for gold
Like a crazy fool I'm a digging in the frozen ground, so cold
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan I wrote my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I said, "Honey, I'm a coming home, please wait for me
And you can tell your dad that I'm coming back a richer man
I've hit the biggest strike in Klondike history" Her dad met the bus in Saginaw, Michigan
And he gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said, "Son, you're wise, young ambitious man
Why don't you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim?" Now he's up there in Alaska digging in the cold, cold ground
That greedy fool is a looking for the gold I never found
But it serves him right and nobody here is missing him
Least of all the newly-weds of Saginaw, Michigan Down a dangerous road, I have come to where I'm standing
With a heavy heart, and my hat clutched in my hand
Such a foolish fool, God ain't known no greater sinner
I have come in search of Jesus, hoping he will understand I had a woman once; she was kind, and she was gentle
Had a child by me, who grew up to be a man
I had a steady job till I started into drinking
And I started making music that went with the devil's band Oh, the years flew by like a mighty rush of eagles
My dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind
It's a lonesome life when you lose the ones you live for
If I make my peace with Jesus, will they take me back again? If I give my soul, will he cleanse these clothes I'm wearin'?
If I give my soul, will he put new boots on my feet?
If I bow my head and beg God for his forgiveness
Will he breathe new breath inside me, and give back my dignity? If I give my soul, will he stop my hands from shaking?
If I give my soul, will my son love me again?
If I give my soul, and she knows I really mean it
If I give my soul to Jesus, will she take me back again? If I give my soul to Jesus, will she take me back again? We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day Keep smilin' through

Always do

The dark clouds
Far away And will you please say hello
To the folks that I know

Well the Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate
Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well a train driver he pulled up to the tollgate
And a man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said I got livestock
I got livestock
I got cows
I got pigs
I got sheep
I got mules
I got all live stock Well he said you're alright boy you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through so he went on through the tollgate
And as he went through he started pickin' up a little bit of speed
Pickin' up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned and looked back at the man he said Well I fooled you
I fooled you
I got pigiron
I got pigiron
I got old pigiron Down the Rock Island Line she's a mighty good road

Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town,
Sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from miles around.
And all the girls from there to Austin,
Were slipping away from home and putting jewelery in hock.
To take the trip, to go and listen,
To the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box. And he would play, Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.
And all the girls from nine to ninety,
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: "Don't stop."
And hypnotized and fascinated,
By the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box. And he would play, Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round,
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town.
But all the girls still dreamed about him.
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
And then one day on the Hit Parade,
Was a little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box. And he would play Anybody got any special requests for us to do
John Henry?
Lemme do John Henry then and we'll go... Johnny Henry's pappy woke him up one midnight
He said "Before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you," Said "Listen boy
Learn to hoist a jack and learn to lay a track learn to pick and shovel too
And take that hammer, It'll do anything you tell it to." John Henry's mammy had about a dozen babies
John Henry's pappy broke jail about a dozen times
The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money
He said, "I'll pay you a quarter at a time starting tomorrow
That's the pay for a steel driver on this line." Then the section foreman said, "Hey! Hammer-swinger!
I see you your own hammer boy but, what all can them muscles do?" and he said,
"I can hoist a jack I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too."
He said "Can you swing a hammer" He said "do anything you hire me to." "Now ain't you something! So high and mighty with all that muscle!"
Go ahead, boy. Pick up that hammer, and show me what you can do!" He said to get a rusted spike and swing it down three times
Pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to
Go on and do what you say you can do With a steel-nosed hammer on a four foot switch handle
John Henry raised it back 'til it touched his heels then
The spike went through the cross-tie and split it half in two
Thirty-five cents a day for driving steel
Said "Sweat, boy! Sweat! Only two more swings!"
"I was born drivin' steel" Well now John Henry hammered in the mountains
He'd give a grunt he give a groan every swing
The women-folks from miles around heard him and come down
To watch make the cold-steel ring "Lord! What a swinger!
Watch him make the cold-steel ring" But the bad boss came up laughin' at John Henry
He said, "You full of vinegar now but you bout' through!
We gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin'
Then what's all them muscles gonna do? Huh? John Henry?
Gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you." John Henry said, "I feed four little brothers
And baby sisters' walkin' on her knees
Now did the Lord say that machines ought to take place of the livin'?
And what's a substitute for bread and beans? I ain't seen it!
Do engines get rewarded for their steam? John Henry said to his captain said "A man ain't nothin' but a man
But if you'll bring that steamdrill 'round I'll beat it fair and honest.
I'll die with that hammer in my hand but, I'll be laughin',
Cause you can't replace a steel-drivin' man. There was a big crowd of people at the mountain.
John Henry said to the steam-drill "How is you?
Said pardon me, Mister Steamdrill I suppose you didn't hear me.
I said how are you Huh?
Can you turn a jack? Can you lay a track? Can you pick and shovel too?
Listen, this hammer-swinger's talkin' to you. Two-thousand people hollered, "Go John Henry!"
Then somebody hollered," The mountain's cavin' in!"
John Henry told the captin, "Tell the kind-folks not to worry
It ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind, it keeps me breathin'
This steel-driver's muscle it ain't thin. "Captain tell the people to move back farther
I'm at the finish line and ain't no drill
It's so far behind that it don't got the brains to quit it
When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills Lord, Lord
When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills" Now, John Henry had a little woman
I believe the lady's name was Paulie Ann yeah that was his good woman
John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home
Early next mornin' he said,
"Come here Paulie Ann, come here sugar.
Said you know I been laying here, watching that sun come up
And I believe this is the first time I've seen the sun come up
That I couldn't come up with it
He said, (dirty mind),
He said take that hammer, Paulie Ann and go to that railroad
And when you swinging with that lead man
You tell em that's not all I can do. Tell em,
I can hoist a jack and I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.
Ain't no machine can that's been proved to you! There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house
The section hands laid him in the sand
Trains go by on the rails John Henry laid.
They slow down and take off the hats,
When they come to whoreys lynn retsina' his back.
They say,"Mornin' Steel-driver, you sure was a hammer-swinger."
Then they go on by pickin' up a little bit of speed.
Clickity clack Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man lord lord
Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man lord lord
Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man Yonder lies a steel-drivin' Thank you very much
You know John Honey was a real man. He worked on a tunnel in West Virginia
Digin' a tunnel for the San Jose railroad.
And he was a mighty big man they say
That from his heels, on around to the ground he had a stroke of 19 feet
Boy that's a long stroke. Wooo that's a long stroke Ira Hayes...
Ira Hayes...
Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war. Gather 'round me people,
There's a story I would tell,
'Bout a brave young Indian,
You should remember well.
From the land of the Pima Indian,
A proud and noble band,
Who farmed the Phoenix Valley,
In Arizona land.
Down the ditches a thousand years,
The waters grew Ira's peoples' crops,
'Til the white man stole their water rights,
And the sparkling water stopped.
Now, Ira's folks were hungry,
And their land grew crops of weeds,
When war came, Ira volunteered,
And forgot the white man's greed. Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war. There they battled up Iwo Jima hill,
Two hundred and fifty men,
But only twenty-seven lived,
To walk back down again.
And when the fight was over,
And Old Glory raised,
Among the men who held it high,
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes. Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war. Ira Hayes returned a hero,
Celebrated through the land,
He was wined and speeched and honored,
Everybody shook his hand,
But he was just a Pima Indian,
No water, no home, no chance,
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done,
And when did the Indians dance. Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war. Then Ira started drinking hard,
Jail was often his home,
They let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone.
He died drunk early one morning,
Alone in the land he fought to save,
Two inches of water and a lonely ditch,
Was a grave for Ira Hayes. Call him drunken Ira Hayes,
He won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey drinking Indian,
Or the marine that went to war. Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes,
But his land is just as dry,
And his ghost is lying thirsty,
In the ditch where Ira died. Life is like a mountain railway
With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave Heed the curves and watch the tunnels
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In that train forevermore Oh, Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In God's grace forevermore To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
"He's an outlaw loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip
"And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip" In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
One and nineteen more Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
After Texas Red Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
Every body held their breath,
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
About to meet his death There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip Big iron, big iron,
Oh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
She said it's two feet high and risin' We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
That's the only thing we got left that'll float
It's already over all the wheat and oats,
Two feet high and risin' How high's the water, mama?
Three feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
She said it's three feet high and risin' Well, the hives are gone,
I lost my bees
The chickens are sleepin'
In the willow trees
Cow's in water up past her knees,
Three feet high and risin' How high's the water, mama?
Four feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
She said it's four feet high and risin' Hey, come look through the window pane,
The bus is coin', gonna take us to the train
Looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain,
Four feet high and risin' How high's the water, mama?
Five feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa?
She said it's five feet high and risin' Well the rails are washed out north of town
We gotta head for higher ground
We can't come back till the water goes down,
Five feet high and risin' Well, it's five feet high and risin' (When he reached down his hand for me)
Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be
But my Saviour in love gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me
I was lost and undone without my God or his son
When he reached down his hand for me
[ guitar ]
I was near to despair when he came to me there
And he showed me that I could be free
Then he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down...
