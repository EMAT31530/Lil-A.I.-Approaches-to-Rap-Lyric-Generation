Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me. Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe. Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe Jai Guru Deva, om.
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh Nah nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah nah, hey Jude

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
In my life-- I love you more Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun

Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you And in the end,
the love you take,
is equal to the love you make,
Ah Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love. There's nothing you can do that can't be done.
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.
Nothing you can say, but you can learn
How to play the game
It's easy.
Nothing you can make that can't be made.
No one you can save that can't be saved.
Nothing you can do, but you can learn
How to be you in time
It's easy. All you need is love, all you need is love,
All you need is love, love. Love is all you need.
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
All you need is love, all you need is love,
All you need is love, love. Love is all you need. There's nothing you can know that isn't known.
Nothing you can see that isn't shown.
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where
You're meant to be
It's easy. All you need is love, all you need is love,
All you need is love, love. Love is all you need.

(Oh, yesterday) There are places I remember all my life
Though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain All these places have their moments
Of lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I loved them all And with all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these mem'ries lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new And I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I loved you more And I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I loved you more
In my life I loved you more Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you know you can't tune it
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever Always know sometimes it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a "Yes"
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly girl I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand [Chorus]
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on
Ob la di ob la da life goes on bra
La la how the life goes on Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing [Chorus] In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band [Chorus] In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening he's a singer with the band [Chorus] And if you want some fun sing ob la di bla da When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine, birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out 'til quarter to three, would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty-four? You'll be older too
Ah
And, if you say the word, I could stay with you I could be handy, mending a fuse, when your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside, Sunday mornings, go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty-four? Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Ah
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave Send me a postcard, drop me a line, stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more
Will you still need me, will you still feed me when I'm sixty-four? Oh yeah I tell you somethin'
I think you'll understand
When I say that somethin'
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand Oh please say to me

Don't let me down Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone, help When I was younger, so much younger than today

And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me And now my life has changed in oh so many ways

Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me When I was younger, so much younger than today

And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Yellow submarine, yellow submarine And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play We all live in a yellow submarine

Juba juba (Oh I'm tired, servicible villain
Set you down father, rest you) I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps. I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you. I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps. I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you. I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps. Oh yeah, all right
Are you gonna be in my dreams tonight? Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you And in the end, the love you take
Is equal to the love you make I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle
Michelle, ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand Michelle, ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you... I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do, I'm telling you so you'll understand
Michelle, ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say "Hello". On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
And little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer. Meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
And though she feels as if she's in a play,
She is anyway. In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain - very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane! Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jojo, go home Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and look so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Man, junior, behave yourself Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well, he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well, this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now junior, behave yourself Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
He took your canary and he fed it to the neighbors cat
He gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, mama's head has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now junior, behave yourself I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her to
I love her She gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her A love like ours

Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed" She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? Well, shake it up baby now

Where do they all belong? Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear

Many years from now.
Will you still be sending me a Valentine.
Birthday greetings bottle of wine.
If I'd been out till quarter to three.
Would you lock the door.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four.
You'll be older too,
And if I say the word,
I could stay with you.
I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday morning go for a ride,
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
Who could ask for more.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four.
Every summer we can rent a cottage,
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera Chuck&Dave;
Send me a postcard, drop me a line,
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Your's sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me

That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. To lead a better life
I need my love to be here Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di. Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again. I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di. Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again. Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup! Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again. I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-di-di-di. Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again. Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again. Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again. Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today... Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too Imagine all the people
Living life in peace You, you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will be as one Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world You, you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will live as one The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door Oh, I need your love, babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you Hold me, love me, hold me, love me

All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl
You want so much it make you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl, girl, girl When I think of all the times
I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl, girl, girl She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
She's cool, ooh, oo, oo, oo
Girl, girl, girl Was she told when she was young
That pain would lead to pleasure
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back
To earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead
Ah, girl, girl, girl
Girl I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus' garden in the shade I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus' garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade. We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus' garden near a cave We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe) We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden with you. One two three four

Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her 'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid get You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind Sheepdog, standing in the rain
Bullfrog, doing it again
Some kind of happiness is
Measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
Something special when you smile Childlike no one understands
Jackknife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is
Measured out in years

To listen to your fears You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me Big man (yeah) walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is
Measured out in you

Back in the USSR
Oh, let me tell you honey Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round Oh You Never Give Me Your Money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations you break down
I never give you my number
I only give my situation
And in the middle of investigation I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But, oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Ah Ah Ah
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes it did (na, na)

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark, tryin to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy him some clothes
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man
His sister Pam works in the shop
She never stops; she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
Who makes the News Of The World
Yes, you could say that she's attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(John) She's coming in the house
(Paul) Oh, look out!
She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh, yeah
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling; do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby.
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling; do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able" Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out,
We can work it out Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night
We can work it out,
We can work it out Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
We can work it out,

Science in the home.
Late nights all alone with a test tube.
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine,
Calls her on the phone.
"Can I take you out to the pictures,
Joa, oa, oa, oan?" But as she's getting ready to go,
A knock comes on the door. Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead. Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again.
Teacher gets annoyed.
Wishing to avoid and unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene, She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away,
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be
So, o, o, o" But when she turns her back on the boy,
He creeps up from behind. Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead. P. C. Thirty-one said, "We caught a dirty one."
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures.
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
So, o, o, o. But as the words are leaving his lips,
A noise comes from behind. Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead. Whoa, oh, oh, oh.
Silver hammer man Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way?"
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away Last night I said these words to my girl

Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman If you drive a car, I'll tax the street,
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat.
If you get too cold I'll tax the heat,
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet. Don't ask me what I want it for
If you don't want to pay some more
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me.

We would drink on the train
On our way to the show, Chicago
Naked Raygun live at the Cabaret Metro
Ten bucks to get into a fight you can't win
Boots and braces, yellow laces
Oxblood traces of the night before We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
(Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na)
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot I can't wait 'til I'm off of work
I'll meet my friends at the Target curb
I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist
I climbed through your window at 3am
We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes
Yeah, we both sang, "Why can't I get one kiss?" We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot We are the broken
No end in sight
We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind
There's no use trying
We lost the war
Now the dead and dying
Are back to even the score We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot I'm a wreck, I'm out of time
I barely made it out alive
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea
I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up, underneath
This heavy burden There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home (find my way home) Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked
When I'm broken There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach (out of reach) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
We'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
Where are you and I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)

The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want

Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you) I miss you (miss you miss you)
(I miss you miss you) I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And I'm still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is A.D.D.?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again? Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops
And your husband's in jail
The state looks down on sodomy And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And I'm still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again? And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again? That's about the time she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never want to act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again? What's my age again? All the small things
True care truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip
Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, commiserating Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill

Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on

I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling, your pictures are falling down The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure did you hear he fucked her?
A day late a buck short I'm writing the report
On losing and failing when I move I'm flailing now And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone I won't come back And it'll happen once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own, well I guess this is growing up Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault I never conquered, when you came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone I never conquered, when you came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
I can't wait till I get home
To pass the time in my room alone In the car I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me
So here I am I'm trying
So here I am are you ready Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always And I'll miss your laugh your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you'd tell me
I'm so sick of fights I hate them
Lets start this again for real So here I am I'm trying
So here I am are you ready
So here I am I'm trying
So here I am are you ready Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night

And I'm quite aware we're dying Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always
Touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always (Get ready for action!)
I got to regret right now (I'm feeling this)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feeling this)
Let me go in her room (I'm feeling this)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feeling this)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feeling this)
Show me the way you move (I'm feeling this)
Fuck it it's such a blur (I'm feeling this)
I love all the things you do (I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Where do we go from here
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this)
Our breathing has got too loud (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feeling this)
Take me away from here (I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna This place was never the same again
After you came and went
How can you say you meant anything different
To anyone standing alone
On the street with a cigarette
On the first night we met Look to the past
And remember her smile
And maybe tonight
I can breathe for a while
I'm not in the seat
I think I'm fallin' asleep
But then all that it means is
I'll always be dreaming of you Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna I said settle down, settle down everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor
She said no I'm not, no I'm not, no I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door She's a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a
She's an angel yeah I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) Oh yeah
We all need something to live for
Oh yeah
We all need something to live for She said I let her down, let her down I no longer dream
Of anything anymore
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all you make me want to scream
And threw herself on the floor She's a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a
She's an angel yeah I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) She's not complicated
Can't be overstated at all
She's not complicated-ated-ated at all I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) (she's out of her mind)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) Oh yeah
We all need something to live for
Oh yeah
We all need something to live for It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted
It's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home
I'd read it every day So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night
Twenty years now lost
It's not right Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them
It makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants
And this is what she wants
Then why is there so much pain? So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night
Twenty years now lost
It's not right So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night
Twenty years now lost
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right I can't get my feet up off the edge
I kinda like the little rush you get
When you're standing close to death
Like when you're driving me crazy Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help us suffer when you're hurt
For real 'cause you were driving me crazy Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
Do you grin inside, you're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end is not too far away
Did you know, I'm here to stay We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are the many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy I can't find the best in all of this
But I'm always looking out for you
'Cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
Do you grin inside, you're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know, I'm here to stay We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on I'm a wreck, I'm out of time
I barely made it out alive
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea
I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up, underneath
This heavy burden There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home (find my way home) Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked
When I'm broken There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach (out of reach) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I'm, I'm not coming home Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I'm, I'm not coming home Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh) I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
(Oh oh oh oh) I said I'm sorry I'm a little bit of a letdown
(Oh oh oh oh) but all my friends are daring me to come over
(Oh oh oh oh) so I come over and over and over
(Oh oh oh oh) so let me buy you a drink and we'll pretend that you think
(Oh oh oh oh) that I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long (Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh life is too short to last long)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) Yeah my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me mexican food from sombrero just because And my girlfriend likes ul and dhc
And she's so smart and independent
I dont think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer And when I feel like giving up like my world is falling down
I show up at three a.m. she's still up watching vacation
And I see her pretty face it takes me away to a better place And I know that everything's gonna be fine Yeah my girlfriend takes collect calls from the road
And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me mexican food from sombrero just because And when I feel like giving up like my world is falling down
I show up at three a.m. she's still up watching vacation
And I see her pretty face it takes me away to a better place And I know that everything's gonna be fine Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
I'm kind of nervous cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and that made it I swear Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fucking explanation I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call
She always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance
I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show With the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show (I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show The drops of rain they fall all over
This awkward silence makes me crazy
The glow inside burns light upon her
I'll try to kiss you if you let me
(this can't be the end)
Tidal waves they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Your vows of silence fall all over
The look in your eyes makes me crazy
I feel the darkness break upon her
I'll take you over if you let me
(You did this)
Tidal waves they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad.
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared stay
I said I'd leave, but I could never leave her
And if I did, you know I'd never cheat her But this I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel, if I should choose to go
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me
Another guy, you think he'd want to fight me She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train I heard it once, I'm sure I heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say you got to turn your back and run now
Come on son, you haven't got a chance now She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now Nineteen, your eyes are glowing to my beating heart
Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
I got my eye on you
Whatcha gonna do Day dream near a stream with the linear bites
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
And I can't picture you but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
And you reached for my hand I was scared in your room
We fell on the floor and we started to move
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop
Up my back they would climb just as I came unglued She said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor
Your eyes they cannot lie as you're dreaming of our future home
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl In the rain with the drink from the back of the bar
I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more
We'd forget that our lives being apart it is hard
We'd thought we were close but it still feels far
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars
If we learn to forgive and accept who we are You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to do it again Wait a minute hold up a second
Don't leave me here with this feeling
Like I'm the one full of regret
Like I never did good for us both
Like you never did pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back
Was I supposed to accept it
When your words are like
More than just sticks and stones
Kinda like a bullet
A hollow tip that lodged in my bones
And I can't just swallow it
My pride is more than all that I own
So I gotta give it away
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
To the song I write til I'm alone at night
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
'Cause I know that me and you is just only right but one It's a cry from the past we have been through a lot
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
And your kids they will reach for the stars up above
We'll sit and relax as we cheer in the morrow
The ropes to the light from the crypt to the grave
We started alone in the end we're okay You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to try it again Im sick of always hearing
All the sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind
An oversensitive guy
That hes lost and alone, yeah I hate our favorite restaurant
Our favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone I cant forgive
Cant forget, cant give in
What went wrong?
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life Im sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place, its fucking cursed
In its plague and I can never escape
When my heart, it explodes I cant forgive
Cant forget, cant give in
What went wrong?
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life Im kicking out fiercely
At the world around me
What went wrong?
Im kicking out fiercely
At the world around me
What went wrong? Im kicking out fiercely
At the world around me
What went wrong?
Im kicking out fiercely
At the world around me
What went wrong? Im kicking Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
I fucked your mom
And I want to suck my dad
And my mama too
Oh, is this thing on? I swear that I can go on forever again
Please let me know that my one bad day will end
I will go down as your lover, your friend
Give me your lips and with one kiss we begin
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you
I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
Where are you now I can hear footsteps I'm dreaming
And if you will, keep me from waking to believe this Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
I'll be fine, it's not the first
Just like last time, but a little worse, and She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, don't let your future be destroyed by my past.
She said, "don't let my door hit your ass." One more chance, I'll try this time
I'll give you yours, I won't take mine
I'll listen up, pretend to care
Go on ahead, I'll meet you there, and She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, "don't let your future be destroyed by my past."
She said, "don't let my door hit your ass." Let's try this one more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
One more time with feeling She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, don't let your future be destroyed by my past.
She said, don't let my door hit your ass Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
And I'll be fine Remember the days
We would drink on the train
On our way to the show, Chicago
Naked Raygun live at the Cabaret Metro
Ten bucks to get into a fight you can't win
Boots and braces, yellow laces
Oxblood traces of the night before We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
(Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na)
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot I can't wait 'til I'm off of work
I'll meet my friends at the Target curb
I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist
I climbed through your window at 3am
We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes
Yeah, we both sang, "Why can't I get one kiss?" We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot We are the broken
No end in sight
We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind
There's no use trying
We lost the war
Now the dead and dying
Are back to even the score We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving you must have your reasons
The season is calling and your pictures are falling down The steps that I retrace the sad look on your face
The timing and structure did you hear he fucked her?
A day late a buck short I'm writing the report
On losing and failing when I move I'm flailing now And it's happened once again I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands and sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave we'll pretend it's okay
The charade it won't last when he's gone I won't come back And it'll happen once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own
Well, I guess this is growing up Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up Everything has fallen to pieces
Earth is dying help me Jesus
We need guidance
We've been misled
Young and hostile
But not stupid
Corporate leaders, politicians
Kids can't vote, adults elect them
Mobs that rule the school and workplace
Signs that caution, sixteen's unsafe We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're f***ed up
You're to blame Let this train wreck burn more slowly
Kids are victims in this story
Drown our youth with useless warnings
Teenage rules they're f***ed and boring We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're f***ed up
You're to blame Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're f***ed up
You're to blame He pauses shaving and he tells himself that he is the bomb
She has her curlers set, her credit cards are paying the funds
He's not that old, I've been told, a strong sexual goal
They go out everyday she goes every way, oh yeah
They don't even care at all She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt
He wants to bone, this I know, she is ready to blow
They go out every night, his pants are super tight, oh yeah
They don't even care at all She's open waiting for more (she's open for more)
And I know he's only looking to score (he's only looking to score)
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk...
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said
Or what you threw at me Please tell me
Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I am sleeping with my cloths on
I came in throught the window... Last night
And your... Gone
Gone It's no suprise to me I am my own worst enemy
Cuz every now and then I kick the living shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going offf and there a cigarette
Still buring Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in throught the windo last night
And your gone
Gone Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I am sleeping with my clothes on
I came inthrough the windo last night It's no suprise to me

Cuz every now and then I kick the livin' shit out of me Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk
I didn't mean to call you that Come here, please hold my hand LORD now
Help me, I'm scared please show me how
To fight this, God has a master plan
And I guess, I am in his demand Please save me, this time I cannot run
And I'll see, you when this is done
And now I, have come to realize
That you are, the one who's left behind Please stay, until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on, to me
I'm right here, waiting I see, the light it feels good
And I'll come, back soon just like you would
It's useless, my name has made the list
And I wish, I gave you one last kiss Please stay, until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on, to me
I'm right here, waiting
And take, my one last breath
And don't forget
That I will be right here, waiting [Repeat: x3] We're falling faster than we can fly
Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive
And I hold on tight
But not enough to hold you back It feels like the moon
Is spinning off into outer space without you
This room is such a lonely place without you I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place I love the lightning but hate the rain
Tomorrow's frightening but not today
Wish I could slow down time
But not enough to slow you down I feel like the moon
Is spinning off into outer space without you
The universe an empty place without you I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place We're falling faster than we can fly
Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place Home is such a lonely place I always flirt with death
I look ill but I don't care about it
I can face your threats and
Stand up straight and tall and shout about it I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you You get under my skin
I don't find it irritating
You always play to win
But I won't need rehabilitating, oh no I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you
Another girl, another planet
Another girl, another planet Space travel's in my blood
There ain't nothing I can do about it
Long journeys wear me out but
I know, I can't live without it oh no I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you Another girl, who's loving you now
Another planet, who's holding you down
Another planet Please, mom
You ground me all the time
I know that I was right
All along And I'm hoping
Remember I'm a kid
I know not what I did
Just having fun You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before Shit, dad
Please don't kick my ass
I know I've seen you trashed
At least one time Can I blame it
On one of my dumb friends
It's been awhile
Since I have used that line You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before (Alright) Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before Beige little boxes in a row
Neighbors and friends that you don't know
Here's a form, go wait in line
Can't you see I'm doing fine, it's what I've always wanted Two little kids out on the lawn
Once we had love, now it's gone
Good things haven't happened yet
I'm empty as a movie set, it's what I've always wanted Hey, here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey, here's to you California Wearing all black out on the beach
Faces I've seen in magazines
Let's take a walk out on the pier
Watch the shoreline disappear, iIt's what I've always wanted Hey, here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey, here's to you California Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh)
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh)
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh)
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh) Hey, here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey, here's to you California Cut the skin to the bone
Fall asleep all alone
Hear your voice in the dark
Lose myself in your eyes
Choke my voice Say goodnight
As the world falls apart
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I need some more time to fix this Here's a letter for you
But the words get confused
And the conversation dies
Apologize for the past
Talk some shit take it back
Are we cursed to this life Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this I'm talking to the ceiling
My life just lost all meaning
Do one thing for me tonight
I'm dying in this silence The last star left in heaven
Is falling down to earth and
Do you still feel the same way
Do you still feel the same way Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over
There's so much more that I wanted and
(So sorry it's over)
There's so much more that I needed and
(So sorry it's over)
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone
Let's take some time to talk this over
You're out of line and rarely sober
We can't depend on your excuses
'Cause in the end it's fuckin' useless
You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long I remember shots without a chaser
Absentminded thoughts, now you're a stranger
Cover up the scars put on your gameface
Left you in the bar to try and save face You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long
So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over
There's so much more that I wanted and
(So sorry it's over)
There's so much more that I needed and
(So sorry it's over)
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone Man on a mission, can't say I miss him around
Insider information, hand in your resignation
Loss of a good friend best of intentions I found
Tight lipped procrastination
Yeah later, see you around (Here we go motherfuckers)
Do you want to come to a party
My friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30
This things at a frat house but the people are cool there
Reluctant I followed but I never dreamed there
Would be someone there who would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching for love or affection
So I paid my 3 and the girls got in free
Shine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party And then in the backyard some terrible ska band
Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame all these girls look the same
All these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed
In my bed back at home watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate down from anywhere state
Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blond hair
She wasn't wearing underwear at least I prayed that
She might be the one maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
But that night I learned some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard to impress
With the way that they dress
With those things on their chests
And the things they suggest to me I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping the games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Fly's
How she's down with the Iwise well constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this
Her volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her but never would bother
Until I got turned down by another girl at a party So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She won't be wearing underwear and you'll discover
This girl's not the one and she'll never be fun
You should just turn and run because you'll find out that
Some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard to impress
With the way that they dress
With those things on their chest
And the things they suggest to me Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard I wanna have the same last dream again
The one where I wake up and I'm alive
Just as the four walls close me within
My eyes are open up with pure sunlight
I'm the first to know
My dearest friends
Even if your hope has burned with time
Anything that is dead shall be re-grown
And your vicious pain, your warning sign
You will be fine hey yo here I am
And here we go
Life's waiting to begin Any type of love it will be shown
Like every single tree reach for the sky
If you're gonna to fall
I'll let you know
That I will pick you up
Like you for I
I felt this thing
I can't replace
Where everyone was working for this goal
Where all the children left without a trace
Only to come back as pure as gold
To recite this so
hey yo here I am
And here we go
Life's waiting to begin
Tonight
hey ohhh here I am
And here we go
Life's waiting to begin
Tonight
hey yo here I am
And here we go
Life's waiting to begin I cannot live
I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live
I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live
I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live
I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live
I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live
I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me hey yo, here I am (do this with me)
Here we go
life's waiting to begin (do this with me)
hey ohhh, here I am (do this with me)
Here we go
life's waiting to begin
Life's waiting to begin. With all of this I know now
Everything inside of my head
It all just goes to show how
Nothing I know changes me at all
Again I waited for this to change instead
To tear the world in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know With all of this I feel now
Everything inside of my heart
It all just seems to be how
Nothing I feel pulls at me at all
Again I waited for this to pull apart
To break my time in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting you And all again I wait for this
To fill a whole, to shake the sky in two
Another night with her
I'm always wanting you
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you Been gone a long time I kinda lost my way, can't find you
And I caught a short ride to the grave and back this season
I can try to get by, but every time I start to panic
I'm a little bit shy, a bit strange and a little bit manic La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land On the narrowing line, what a way to sort my troubles
In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover
Can you figure me out? I got caught like a little kid stealing
Did I say it too loud? A bit hard or a little misleading La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land Everyone wants to call it all around our life with a better name
Everyone falls and spins and gets up again with a friend who does the same
Everyone lies and cheats their wants and needs and still believes their heart
And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when the pain begins to start Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night Everyone's cross to bears are the crown they wear on endless holiday
Everyone raises kids in a world that changes life to a bitter game
Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to celebrate the day
And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we die alone some day Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitude's a reason to die Just you wait and see (just you wait and see)
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
I guess its just another
(I had sex with your mother) night alone Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again Just you wait and see (just you wait and see)
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
I guess its just another
Night alone Thanks a lot you guys!
Hey kids, it's Satan. Thanks a lot for coming on down to
The show tonight. Hope you all had a great time. I know I did
Those Blink fellas sure put on a kick ass show, huh. Hope to see
You all at the after show party. I'm gonna start sucking dicks
And squeezin' titties, maybe I can put my peepee in your mouth
I love it when the kids come on over and I get, I have them suck
And kiss my peepee tenderly and gently. I like it when the kids sit
On my lap, and talk about unicorns and flowers and things like that
Maybe I'll even suck their blood. See ya kids later! Hey, how you guys doin' up in the back? Now from the top balcony
Can I get an Amen? Now from the floor, can I get a Hallelujah? Now from
All these other assholes, can I get an oh yeah? On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on I learned a lot today
Not sure if I'll get laid and
Not sure if I'll fail or pass
Kissed every girl in class
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar
Size extra large Sip a drink of the alcohol
End up kneeling in bathroom stalls
Eyes are red and my movements slow
Too high, got vertigo He took a shit in the bathroom tub
And fed the dog brownie drugs
Tried hard not to get caught
He fucked a chick in the parking lot On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar
Size extra large Break a window and bust a wall
Making fun of your friend's mom
Turn the music up way too loud
Charge the pizza to the house
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar
Size extra large It'd be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
From your mom My Dearest,
I've missed you very, very much since that last night we were together, and will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come. I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately.
I've read your letter through at least four times, and will probably read it more times before I'm through. I've been sitting here, looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute. I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of, except, of course, you yourself.
I keep thinking of you, Darling, keep wishing I could be home with you. I want to leave in the worst possible way so I can come home to see you, but things don't look so good on that subject. But this war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone, I guess.
I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now. I'm completely lost without you, Darling. I never realized I could miss any one person so much. I just hope it won't be too much longer until I'm able to be with you again... and live a sane and normal life. I'm sick of always hearing
All the sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy
That he's lost and alone, yeah I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
'Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place is fucking cursed in its plague
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life I'm kicking out fiercely of the world around me
What went wrong I'm kicking Don't wanna hear the static on the TV screen
Don't wanna live a life of cellphone memories When did you go missing?
Where did I go wrong?
Sometimes I just don't know where I belong Save yourself where I was saving
We're not the same, we're two in a million
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
We've gone through hell, the battles we fought 'em
We stood as one, the young and forgotten
These are the good old days
These are the good old days You're not the only one who grew up feeling scared
You're not the only broken heart gone un-repaired Everyone's gone missing
Everyone's done wrong
Sometimes we both fly too close to the sun Save yourself where I was saving
We're not the same, we're two in a million
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
We've gone through hell, the battles we fought 'em
We stood as one, the young and forgotten
These are the good old days
These are the good old days You're giving up
We're getting out
We were young and we're not growing up
We're not growing up You're giving up
We're getting out
We were young and we're not growing up
We're not growing up Save yourself where I was saving
We're not the same, we're two in a million
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
We've gone through hell, the battles we fought 'em
We stood as one, the young and forgotten
These are the good old days
These are the good old days These are the good old days
These are the good old days These are the good old days
These are the good old days Last night it came as a picture
With a good reason, a warning sign
This place is void of all passion
If you can imagine it's easy if you try
Believe me I failed this effort
I wrote a reminder this wasn't a vision
This time where are you Houston
Is somebody out there will somebody listen Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you My head is made up of memories
Most of them useless delusions
This room is bored of rehearsal
And sick of the boundaries
I miss you so much Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
This time I don't want to
Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
This time I don't want to
Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you Sometimes I wonder where our lives go
They question who we used to be
Sometimes I feel like I'm the oxygen between
The cigarette and gasoline I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego) Abandoned houses with the lights on (oh, oh, oh)
Late at night I call your name (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Abandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors
I read the sadness on your face I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego) I never needed to hear
All of the pain and the fear
Your secrets filled up my ears
Like the ocean blue
I never wanted to know
How deep these cuts on you go
And like a river they flow
To the ocean blue Going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost at San Diego (San Diego) (to San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (San Diego) (can't go back to San Diego) I got no regret right now
(I'm feeling this)
The air is so cold and numb
(I'm feeling this)
Let me go in her room
(I'm feeling this)
I wanna take off her clothes
(I'm feeling this) Show me the way to bed
(I'm feeling this)
Show me the way you move
(I'm feeling this)
Fuck it it's such a blur
(I'm feeling this)
I love all the things you do
(I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Where do we go from here
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear
(I'm feeling this)
Our breathing has got too loud
(I'm feeling this) Show me the bedroom floor
(I'm feeling this)
Show me the bathroom mirror
(I'm feeling this)
Were taking this way too slow
(I'm feeling this)
Take me away from here
(I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna This place was never the same again after you came and went
How can you say you meant anything different
To anyone standing alone on the street
With a cigarette on the first night we met Look to the past and remember her smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
I'm not in this scene I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
(Fate fell short this time)
Your smile fades in the summer
(Your smile fades in the summer)
Place your hand in mine
(Place your hand in mine)
I'll leave when I wanna
(I'll leave when I wanna) Fate fell short this time
(Fate fell short this time)
Your smile fades in the summer
(So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
(Place your hand in mine)
I'll leave when I wanna
(So lost and disillusioned) Fate fell short this time
(Are we alone do you feel it)
Your smile fades in the summer
(So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
(Are we alone do you feel it)
I'll leave when I wanna
(So lost and disillusioned) Fate fell short this time
(Are we alone do you feel it)
Your smile fades in the summer
(So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
(Are we alone do you feel it)
I'll leave when I wanna
(So lost and disillusioned) I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na I woke up in the pouring rain
West Side Humboldt 7am
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye Because I bet you couldn't knock me out
And I guess you, you really got me now
Black sedan ran a red light
Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober) She undressed and we stumbled downstairs
Fell onto the table as the neighbors just stared
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside And she dragged me to the edge of town
And she slapped me then she pulled me down
I can do bad and you can do better
Spending all night getting lost together I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober Sober
Sober I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober) Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober) All the small things
True care truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip
Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, commiserating Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on
The night will go on
My little windmill Please take me by the hand
It's so cold out tonight, I'll
Put blankets on the bed
I won't turn out the light, just
Don't forget to think about me and I
Won't forget you
"I'll write you once a week," she said Why does it feel the same
To fall in love or break it off
And if young love is just a game then
I must have missed the kick off
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on
Anything but I'd go through hell for you and I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me I'll think about the times
She kissed me after class
And she put up with my friends
I acted like an ass, I'd
Ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker? I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucking weasel
His issues make my mind ache
Want to make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions
You do with your pigtails
What a nice creation
Worth another night in jail He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out
When friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his fathers tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one, I'm giving up she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag So all you little ladies
Be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe
I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache
Want to make a deal Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl chose the one guy who makes you want to kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy who took and ran away He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out
When friends were listening to slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his fathers tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one, I'm giving up she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag Fuck this place, I lost the war
I hate you all, your mom's a whore
Where's my dog?
'Cause girls are such a drag Eyes are, open words are spoken
Here's to the sunrise
Head is loaded cards are folded
Under the moonlight Can you remember, you remember the last time
We woke up sober?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
You ran me over? Are we halfway gone or halfway there? Left alone
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones
Fall into the unknown Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder Mind is open, thoughts are woken
There goes the sunrise
Heart is broken, love unspoken
Here comes the moonlight Can you remember, you remember the last time
I left hungover?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
That I stayed over? Are we halfway gone or halfway there? Left alone
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones
Fall into the unknown Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder (Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh) Left alone
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones
Fall into the unknown Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder (Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh) Josie, you're my
Source of most frustration
Forget when I
Don't meet expectations
Everything you wished came true
In the end we all blamed you
Even though, as they all know you weren't the only one, two, three, four Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down, I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I gotta wonder why you'd leave it out for me (shit!) Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down, I'm hating everything
And you are getting rides home in his car
You're making out in his front yard, I'm hating everything Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? And if we can have another day
I've got so much left to say, I'd tell you everything
And I'll laugh when I think about the past
When I see you after class, you're hating everything Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? And she said, (na na na na na na na na na na na na na)
"I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na)
"I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na)
"I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na) Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? And she said, (na na na na na) Can you read my thoughts, I'm not sure what I said
I feel dumb and long night coming Did you steal my prayers I don't know where I was
I feel numb and all or nothing
(All or nothing) It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go
'Cause we got no control
(No control) It's Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands Till Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend I can feel my head falling off my neck
I need something
To keep going So just take my hand
Only seconds left
The clock's running
Our time's coming Aaah! It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go
'Cause we got no control
(No control) It's Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands Till Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go
'Cause we got no control
(No control) It's Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands Till Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend This is the first (thing I remember)
Now it's the last (thing left on my mind)
Afraid of the dark (do you hear me whisper)
An empty heart (replaced with paranoia)
Where do we go (life's temporary)
After we're gone (like new years resolutions)
Why is this hard (do you recognize me)
I know I'm wrong (but I can't help believing) I'm so lost
I'm barely here
I wish I could explain myself
But words escape me
It's too late
To save me
You're too late
You're too late You're cold with disappointment
While I'm drowning in the next room
The last contagious victim of this plague between us
I'm sick with apprehension
I'm crippled from exhaustion
And I dread the moment when you finally come to kill me This is the first (thing I remember)
Now it's the last (thing left on my mind)
Afraid of the dark (do you hear me whisper)
An empty heart (replaced with paranoia)
Where do we go (life's temporary)
After we're gone (like new years resolutions)
Why is this hard (do you recognize me)
I know I'm wrong (but I can't help believing) Crossed the street
Naked at night
Bent over to show some moonlight
Pulled out some beer and gulped it down
Nude in a gutter is how I was found
Thrown in a police car and the door slammed
No noise just silence as I screamed my dick was jammed
Now in prison for one month no one to see
All I got is this guy Ben Dover Don't like hesh-don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally cause she's fat
I'm a jerk I'm a punk
Took a shower cause I stunk
Smoked a bong killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs Went to a farm to tip some cows
Forgot that I left my pants down
Bent over to pick them up
Felt a twelve gauge next to my shit
The farmer took me to his house
Showed me the closet from the inside out
The police came and took me away
Saw Ben Dover again and he's still gay Don't like hesh-don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally cause she's fat
I'm a jerk I'm a punk
Took a shower cause I stunk
Smoked a bong killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude-I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs When the clock strikes two,
There's just so much to do
And I can't explain what I need
Jobs and social groups
Hearing the latest news
Keeping our reputations clean
And I, don't want to worry
About being on time
I've seen the way you hurry
And time runs your life
Again
The difference between east and west
Money is so much less
Not that I'm poor, just to fine
I wish that the clock would often just be stopped
And then we'd look
Into the time
And I, don't want to worry
About being on time
I've seen the way you hurry
And time runs your life I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel
Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitudes a reason to die Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone Let's get started, the faint and broken-hearted
Hold it up, I've got something I cannot hide
Worst painkiller, that all-in filler
The apart and departed look in my eyes Sad, how far you ran, I'll search this land
Up through the clouds then back here
We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb
At all hours I'm empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight I will follow the trail to tomorrow
With my loneliness with sorrow all through the night
Sons and daughters, mothers and their fathers
Just the bridges and the waters their clues left behind Sad, how far you ran, I'll search this land
Up through the clouds then back here
We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb
At all hours I'm empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight I'm empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight
Goodnight There she was like a starry night
Like a Ferris wheel, full of blue green eyes
And a heart of steel always on her own
Almost never real
When the night will begin
The pain it won't end even if she falls in love
Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack
Even if she falls in love
And she was like a blade of ice
Like a lonely road clears day of life
Always sharp and cold always beautiful
I am such a fool When the night will begin
The pain won't end even if she falls in love
Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack
Even if she falls in love Try to look in her eyes the light is just right
Even if she falls in love and it isn't so bad it's
Driving you mad even if she falls in love There's a cynical feeling saying I should give up
You said everything you'll ever say
There's a moment of panic when I hear the phone ring
Anxiety's calling in my head Is it back again?
Are you back again? Don't wake me up before you leave
Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed (woah oh oh oh)
I feel your hand unlock the door
Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil (woah oh oh oh) What's the point of saying sorry now
Lost my voice while fighting my way out (while fighting my way out) What's the point of saying sorry now (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry)
Lost my voice while fighting my way out (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry now) Dear head, shut up
I can't listen no more
It's late, so shut up
Is one night too much to ask for You are a haunted house
You're superstitious
You are the coldest stone-carved marble faces I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again This bed, on fire
I can't sleep here no more
Too late and tired
Dreaming down on the floor I'm a haunted house
I'm superstitious
I am a cardboard cutout, old and faded I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won't fall down, I won't fall down)
I'm barely standing on the ground (Barely standing on the ground)
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole) Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh Where the hell did you come from, outer space or heaven above
Short of breath my long-lost love
I can't believe my eyes, are you for real? My life before was such a mess
There's no use dwelling on the past
My broken heart was in a cast
Then you showed up and it began to heal 'Cause you're the only thing that matters
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
'Cause you're the only thing I feel Someday
You'll come back to me
And I'll say
Something bitterly And you'll go racing toward the kitchen
Grab a knife, erase my vision
Take my flatscreen television
And my paintings by Marilyn Manson 'Cause you're the only thing that matters
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
'Cause you're the only thing I feel 'Cause you're the only thing that matters
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
'Cause you're the only thing I feel Six bottles went down the drain
One hours waste of time
I'd ask if you feel the same
Still pushing that chance to try
Your breath in this cool room chill
Long hair that blows side to side
You speak and make time stand still
And each time walk right on by? Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever, and after Can't count all the eyes that stare
Can't count all the things they see
She kills with no life to spare
Just victims left to bleed
One drink and the pain goes down
Soft shadows lay by her feet
Lay soft as you slowly drown
Lay still while you fall asleep
(Fall asleep) Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
(And after, and after, and after) Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me,
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after Push it out, fake a smile
Avert disaster just in time
I need a drink, cause in a while
Worthless answers from friends of mine
It's dumb to ask, cool to ignore
Girls possess me but they're never mine
I made my entrance
Avoided hazards
Checked my engine I fell behind I fell behind She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy Remember when I was in
The grocery store, now's my time
Lost the words, lost the nerve,
Lost the girl, left the line
I would wish upon a star
But that star, it doesn't shine
So read my book, with a boring ending
A short story of a lonely guy Who fell behind She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move cause I'm still
Just a stupid, worthless boy She didn't mean to deceive you, believe me
But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving The good intentions that you had
Now only came to this
And although she saw the mark
The arrow missed It isn't exciting reciting the stories
Of kind words turned hurting when routine gets boring Both getting tired of punk rock clubs
And both playing in punk rock bands
The start was something good
But some good things must end And she said, "It could never survive
With such differing lives
One home, one out on tour again We may never come back
The strike of a match
The candle's burning at both ends." And now she knows too much
And I'm too fucked up
It's awkward trying to make my move I'll pretend that I'm fine
Show up right on time
But I know I'll never be that cool I never wanted to hold you back
I just wanted to hold on
But my chance is gone I know just where I stand, a boy
Trapped in the body of a man and I'll take what you're willing to give
And I'll teach myself to live
With a walk-on part of a background shot
From a movie I'm not in She's so important
And I'm so retarded And now I realize
I should have kissed you in L.A.
But I drove home all alone
As if I had a choice, anyway Where are you coming from?
What are you running from?
Is it so hard to see? And if you're feeling scared
Remember the time we shared
You know it meant everything (everything)
You know that it meant everything to me You know that it meant everything to me I think of awhile ago
We might have had it all
But I was so stupid then
You needed time to grow
But now just as things change
As well my feelings do
In time things rearrange
I am so sick of chasing you But what do I get
'Cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret
Those times I spent with you
And playing those games
A I wait for your call
And now I give up,
So goodbye and so long It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night You have your other friends
They were there
When you cried
Didn't mean to hurt you then
Best friends just won't
Leave your side But what do I get
'Cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret
Those times I spent with you
And playing those games
As I wait for your call
And now I give up,
So goodbye and so long It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night When I needed you most
When I needed a friend
You let me down now
Like I let you down then So sorry, it's over
(Ah) One thing / I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on / but didn't even know
Wasted it all just to
Watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I tried
so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
One thing / I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (far)
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter I saw you again
I think you used me again
Should we try this before we give up and move on
And pretend to restore what we have and hold on
At times like these
It's obvious
I saw you again
I know you fucked him again
Can you comfort yourself with a sense of revenge
Are you leaving me here with the taste of the end At times like these
It's obvious
At times like these
It's obvious I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision Day in day out
Up at 3 AM with the searchlights shining down
Day in day out
It's the blinding light underneath the dirt downtown
Whoa
Listen to the sound as they bomb the Sixth Street Bridge
Whoa
Listen to the sound of the voices south of Fifth In Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home
(I'm never coming, I'm never coming) Come down
I've been awake for days
Knocked out
By the sound of falling rain
Come down yeah we'll watch the sun just burn away the sky
Watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home [Verse 1: Matt Skiba]
Late at night on mercy street
The summer air is way too sweet
The way I feel inside is worse than poison Washed up standing on a beach
Something inside is incomplete
I numb the pain for one more night of mourning This is the one last time
I promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home) [Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
The tidal wave and aftermath
I'm seasick from the years we've passed
Adrift at sea with no one left to rescue Tonic and a fifth of gin
She said goodbye and left again
These empty rooms are deafening without you This is one last time
I promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home) [Bridge: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
Life's so strange
Time won't change
The world slips by, I'm afraid that she never gave much anyway
Life's so strange [Outro: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home) 
There must be some kind of way outta here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief Business men, they drink my wine
Plowman dig my earth
None were level on the mind
Nobody up at his word
Hey, hey No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin' falsely now
The hour's getting late, hey All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl [Intro]
Hey Joe
Where you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe
I said where you going with that gun in your hand? [Verse 1]
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
And that ain't too cool [Verse 2 ]
Hey Joe
I heard you shot your woman down
Shot her down, now
Hey Joe
I heard you shot your old lady down
You shot her down to the ground [Verse 3]
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught her messing around, messing around town
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught my old lady messing around town
And I gave her the gun
I shot her! [Guitar Solo/Bridge]
Hey Joe, alright
Shoot her one more time, baby [Verse 4]
Hey Joe, said now
Where you going to run to now?
Where you going to run to?
Hey Joe, I said
Where you going to run to now?
Where you, where you going to go?
Well, dig it [Verse 5]
I'm going way down south
Way down to Mexico way
Alright
I'm going way down south
Way down where I can be free
There's no one going to find me [Verse 6]
There's no hangman going to
He ain't gonna put a rope around me
You better believe it right now
I got to go now [Outro]
Hey Joe
You better run on down
Goodbye everybody, ow!

Foxy lady After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterdays life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind, it cries Mary The traffic lights they all true blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
Cause the life that lived is, is dead
And the wind screams Mary Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
And with his crutch, its old age, and it's wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary Wild thing, you make my heart sing
You make everything groovy, wild thing
Wild thing, I think I love you
But I wanna know for sure
Come on and hold me tight
I love you Wild thing, you make my heart sing
You make everything groovy, wild thing

With a circus mind
That's running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
And fairly tales That's all she ever thinks about Riding the wind When I'm sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free It's alright, she says

So easy to explain
After they crucified him,
A woman, she claimed his name
The story of jesus
The whole Bible knows
Went all across the desert
And in the middle, he found a rose There should be no questions
There should be no lies
He was married ever happily after
All the tears we cry
No use in arguing
All the use to the man that moans
When each man falls in battle
His soul it has to roam
Angles of heaven
Flying saucers to some,
Made easter sunday
The name of the rising sun The story is written
By so many people who dared,
To lay down the truth
To so very many who cared
To carry the cross
Of jesus and beyond
We will guide the light
This time with a woman in our arms
We as men
Can't explain the reason why
The woman's always mentioned
At the moment that we die
All we know
Is God is by our side,
And he says the word
So easy yet so hard I wish not to be alone,
So I must respect my other heart
Oh, the story
Of jesus is the story
Of you and me
No use in feeling lonely,
I am searching to be free Angel came down from Heaven yesterday
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow And I said, "Fly on my sweet Angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet Angel
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side" Sure enough this morning came on to me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my Angel, she said on to me
"Today is the day for you to rise" Take my hand, you're gonna be my man
You're gonna rise and then she took me high over yonder And I said, "Fly on my sweet Angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet Angel
Forever I will be by your side" Ah yeah!
There's a red house over yonder,
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, there's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong, lord, have mercy
This key won't unlock this door,
Something's goin' on here
I have a bad bad feeling
That my baby don't live her no more Well, I might as well go back over yonder,
Way back up on the hill
That's something to do
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder,
Way back yonder cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will
Yeah. It's getting near dawn,
When lights close their tired eyes.
I'll soon be with you my love,
To give you my dawn surprise.
I'll be with you darling soon,

To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love. I'm with you my love,

We'll hold hands and then we'll watch the sunrise
From the bottom of the sea But first, are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?

Peopled called you, said 'beware the doll, you're bound to fall',
You thought they were all kidding you

About having to be scrounging around for your next meal How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
In no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone (Yeah, sing a song bro'...)
If the sun refused to shine

Nothing can harm me at all

With my waterfall I can see
My rainbow calling me
Through the misty breeze
Of my waterfall Some people say
Daydreaming's for all the
Lazy minded fools
With nothin' else to do
So let them laugh, laugh at me
So just as long as I have you
To see me through
I've got nothing to lose
Long as I have you Waterfall
Don't ever change your ways
Fall with me for a million days
Oh, my waterfall Well, I'm a voodoo chile
Lord I'm a voodoo chile Well, the night I was born
Lord I swear the moon turned a fire red
The night I was born
I swear the moon turned a fire red
Well my poor mother cried out "Lord, the gypsy was right!"
And I seen her, fell down right dead
(Have mercy) Well, mountain lions found me there waitin'
And set me on an eagle's back
Well, mountain lions found me there
And set me on an eagle's wing
(It's the eagle's wing, baby, what did I say?)
He took me past to the outskirts of infinity
And when he brought me back
He gave me a Venus witch's ring
Hey
And he said "Fly on, fly on"
Because I'm a voodoo chile, yeah, voodoo chile
Hey Well, I make love to you
And Lord knows you'll feel no pain
Say, I make love to you in your sleep
And Lord knows you felt no pain
(Have mercy)
'Cause I'm a million miles away
And at the same time I'm right here in your picture frame
(Yeah! What did I say now)
'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows, I'm a voodoo chile
(Yeah!) Well my arrows are made of desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulphur mines
Say my arrows are made of desire, desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulphur mines
(Way down by the Methane Sea, yeah)
I have a humming bird and it hums so loud
You think you were losing your mind, hmmm Well I float in liquid gardens
And Arizona new red sand
(Yeah)
I float in liquid gardens
Way down in Arizona red sand Well, I taste the honey from a flower named Blue
Way down in California
And the in New York drowns as we hold hands 'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile Down the street you can hear her scream you're a disgrace
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries oh, girl you must be mad,
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?
Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
And his tears fall and burn the garden green And so castles made of sand fall in the sea, eventually A little Indian brave who before he was ten,
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built the dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief
Many moons past and more the dream grew strong
Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song
And fight his first battle but something went wrong,
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night And so castles made of sand melts into the sea, eventually There was a young girl, who's heart was a frown
Cause she was crippled for life,
And she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop living,
So she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled you wont hurt me no more
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
Look a golden winged ship is passing my way! And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on going... And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, eventually Told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And when it was time for her to leave she spread her wings high over me
And said I shall return tomorrow And I said fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet, sweet angel
Tomorrow I shall have you by my side Sure enough this mornin' came to me
Silver wings silhouetted against the golden rose of today's sunrise
And the angel she bent down and told me
You'll never have to worry about this place just wipe your weepin' eyes
I'll take you where you've never been, you can fly
I looked around and I thought Fly on my little angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'll be by your side
I got my wings to fly Yeah!
Lord, I feel the ocean swaying me
Washing away all my pain
See where I used to be wounded
Remember the scars, now you can't see a thing
And I don't feel no pain oh no
Hey!

And she said "I shall return tomorrow" And I said "fly on my sweet angel,
fly on through the sky,

When silver wings silhouetted against the glow of the child's sunrise
And as the bluebirds and the sparrows envy me,
she says "I love you little boy
and today you shall fly"
She kissed me once
and the feelings so good she made me cry
And now, we can fly together And I said "fly on my sweet angel,

together we shall always be high" Golden rose, the color of the dream I had

Misty blue and lilac too
Gold and rose, gold are rose, gold and rose. It's only a dream
I'd love to tell somebody about this dream
The sky was filled with a thousand stars
While the sun kissed the mountains blue
And eleven moons played across rainbows
Above me and you.
Gold and rose the color of the velvet walls surround us. Everyday in the week I'm in a different city
If I stay too long people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog
Talkin' about the clothes I wear

Towering in shiny metallic purple armour
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,
They quietly understand
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,
But wonder why the fight is on
But they're all bold as love, yeah, they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Just ask the axis My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war,
And ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring,
But very unsteady for the first go round
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from, eh,
Giving my life to a rainbow like you
But, I'm bold as love, yeah, I'm bold as love
Yeah, yeah
Well I'm bold, bold as love (hear me talking, girl)
I'm bold as love
Just ask the axis (he knows everything)
Yeah,
Yeah,
Yeah! I just want to talk to you
I won't uh, do you no harm
I just want to know about your diff'rent lives
On this is here people farm
I heard some of you got your families
Living in cages tall and cold
And some just stay there and dust away
Past the age of old.
Is this true ?
Please let me talk to you. I just wanna know about
The rooms behind your minds
Uh do I see a vacuum there
Or am I going blind ?
Or is it just uh, remains of vibrations
And echoes long ago ?
Uh things like "Love the world" and uh
Uh "Let your fancy flow"
Is this true ?
Please let me talk to you
Let me talk to you. I have lived here before
The days of ice
And of course this is why
I'm so concerned
And I come back to find
The stars misplaced
And the smell of a world
That is burned
A smell of a world
That is burned. Yeah well, maybe, hmm...
Maybe it's just a... change of climate
Hmm, hmm...
Well I can dig it

Somebody has to sing
Some body will sing?
Somebody will sing, right?
(I don't know!) Y'all pass me that bottle,
And I'll sing you all a real song
Yeah!
Let me get my key, ahum! Well, I'm looking through Harlem
my stomach squeal just a little more
A stagecoach full of feathers and footprints,
pulls up to soap box door
Now a lady with a pearl handled necktie
Tied to the driver's fence
breathes in my face,
bourbon and coke possessed words
& "Haven't I seen you somewhere in hell,
or was it just an accident?"
(You know how I felt then, and so:) Before I could ask "was it the East or West side?"
my feet they howled in pain
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep,
but not as deep in my mind as the rain
And as they pulled away I could see her words
Stagger and fall on my muddy tent
Well I picked them up, brushed them off,
to see what they say,
and you wouldn't believe:
`Come around to my room, with the tooth in the middle,
and bring along the bottle and a president' And eh sometimes it's not so easy, baby
Especially when your only friend,
talks, sees, looks and feels like you,
and you do just the same as him
(Gets very lonely up this road, baby)
(Yeah, hmmm, yeah)
(Got more to say!) Well I'm riding through LA (huh),
on a bicycle built for fools
And I seen one of my old buddies
And he say, "you don't look the way you usually do"
I say, "well, some people look like a coin-box"
He say, "look like you ain't got no coins to spare"
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this:
I just picked up my pride from underneath the pay phone,
and combed this breath right out of my hair
And sometimes it's not so easy
Especially when your only friend
talk, sees, looks and feels like you,
and you do just the same as him just got out of a Scandinavian jail,
and I'm on my way straight home to you
But I feel so dizzy I take a quick look in the mirror,
to make sure my friend's here with me too
And you know good well I don't drink coffee,
so you fill my cup full of sand
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom
Sharing lipstick around the broken edge
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on
And your cat he attacked me from his pill-box ledge
And I thought you were my friend too
Man, my shadow comes in line before you
I'm finding out that it's eh not so easy
Specially when your only friend
Talks, looks, sees and feels like you,
and you do the same just like him (Lord it's so lonely here, hmmm, yeah)
Yeah!
(Pass me that bottle over there...)
Yeah, yeah, okay... Peoples, peoples, peoples
You know what it means to be left alone
Peoples, peoples, people
You know what it means to be left alone
Yeah
Lord it happened to day
Lord not even a call on my telephone
Understandin'
Lord a little love in the world is all I need
A little love and understanding baby
It's all in the world I need
Lose of love
A misunderstanding of a no good woman
Lord they've both caused my heart to bleed
All right Every mornin'
Every mornin' the willows weep among for me
Every mornin' yes the willows weep among for me
The birds sang the love song
My baby's caused my heart to bleed She walks with a bell-clock round her neck
So the hippies think she's in with time
Time
Her hair glistens like robins on a deck
Branches attack me from her neck She's so fine
She's so very very fine The sun from a cloud sinks into her eyes
The rain from a tree soaks into her mind
Mind
Morning sign sounds just like a lock
All these signs are always a stock She's so fine
She's so very very fine When I veer I get so near
But so far far far away
Listen to me, today We united just beside a leaf
The ground was hard underneath her Ahhhahhh
She's so fine
Ahhhahhh The morning is dead
And the day is, too
There's nothing left here to meet me
But the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's like a little more than enough
To make a man throw himself away And I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Alone Now the smiling portrait of you
Is still hangin' on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the ever falling dust
That makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring layin' on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Lord, alone Loneliness is such a drag So here I sit to face
That same old fire place
Gettin' ready for the same old explosion
Goin' through my mind
And soon enough time will tell,
About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone to toll my bell And I continue
To burn this old lamp
Lord, alone
Darlin' can't ya hear me callin' you?
So lonely
Gonna have to blow my mind
Lonely Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
But I know for sure
I don't live today
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
No-ho sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
I wish you'd hurry up and rescue me
So I can be on my miserable way
(well), I don't
Live today
Maybe tomorrow, I just can't say, but, uh
I don't
Live today
It's such a shame to waste your time away like this
Existing
Well, uh-i don't
Live today
Maybe tomorrow, I just can't tell you baby, but, uh
Oh, I don't
Live today
Its such a shame to spend the time
Away like this
Existing
Yeah
Ow

Oh, no
Yeah
Oh, there ain't no life no where
Uh-ha, {cough}-hmm, {sniff}
Down, man
(are) you experienced? {clap}
Get experienced {clap}
Get experienced
Uh, get experienced {clap}
Uh, get experienced {clap} (bv=[are] you experienced? )
Are you experienced? (bv={clap} are you experienced? ) Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
Chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an island
Might even raise just a little sand
'Cause I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child I didn't mean to take you up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back to you one of these days
I said, I didn't mean to take you up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back to you one of these days
And if I don't meet you no more in this world
Then I'll, I'll meet you in the next one
And don't be late, don't be late
'Cause I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child
I'm a voodoo child Hurray I awake from yesterday
Alive but the war is here to stay
So my love catherina and me
Decide to take our last walk thru the noise to the sea
Not to die but to be reborn
Away from the lands so battred and torn
Forever forever Oh say can you see it's really such a mess
Every inch of earth is a fighting nest
Giant pencil and lipstick-tube shaped things
Continue to rain and cause screamin' pain
And the arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red
As our feet find the sand
And the sea is straight ahad
Straight up ahead Well it's too bad that our friends can't be with us today
Well it's too bad
The machine that we built
Would never save us that's what they say
That's why they ain't comin' with us today
And they also said it's impossible
For a man to live and breathe undrerwater
Forever was a main complaint
Yeah and they also threw this in my face they said
Anyway you know good and well
It would be beyond the will of god
And the grace of the king
Grace of the king
Yeah Ooo So my darling and I make love in the sand
To salute the last moment ever on dry land
Our machine it has done it's work played it's part well
Without a scratch on our body when we bid it farewell
Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile
Before our heads go under we take our last look at the killing noise
Of the out of style
The out of style out of style oh yeah
Oooo So down and down and down and down we go
Hurry my darlin' we mustn't be late
For the show
Neptune champion games to an aqua world is so my dear
Right this way smiles a mermaid
I can hear atlantis full of cheer
Atlantis full of cheer
I can hear atlantis full of cheer

Of the experience, and every once in a while we're blowing

A band of gypsies. we have billy cox playin' bass, and um from

Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin He left home when he was seventeen
The rest of the world he had longed to see
And everybody knows boss
A rolling stone gathers no moss Now you'd probably call him a tramp
But it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile
Dame Now some people say he had a girl back home
Messed around and did a bit a wrong
They tell me it kinda hurt him bad
Kinda made him feel pretty sad I couldn't say what went through his mind
Anyway he left the world behind

In love or war you can lose your glory Now you'd probably a-call him a tramp
But I know it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile
Walk on brother

Lookin for my Dallas honey bee

Where can you be?
Lord help me Oh, say can you see
By the dawns early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilights last gleaming?
Who's broad striped and bright stars
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare!
The bombs bursting in air!
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave? It's very far away
It takes about a half and a day to get there

Now to the right you will see Saturn
Outta sight, really outta sight
And if you look to the left you'll see Mars
Yeah, OK. Yeah, OK.
I hope your brought your parachute with you
Hey! Hey, look out! Look out for that door!
Don't open that door!
Don't open that door!
(Ah, man!)
That's the way it goes
And now we're coming through the Milky Way section, yeah
Bring your cornflakes and stuff like that, Milky Way
Yeah, everything is all right, outta sight
If you look around you, you will see a few minds being blown
It's happening, it's happening
Yeah!
I hope you enjoy your ride; I am! Hurray, I awake from yesterday
Alive, but the war is here to stay
So my love, Catherina and me,
decide to take our last walk through the noise to the sea
Not to die but to reborn,
away from lands so battered and torn
Forever, forever Oh say, can you see it's really such a mess
Every inch of Earth is a fighting nest
Giant pencil and lipstick tube shaped things,
Continue to rain and cause screaming pain
And the arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red
as our feet find the sand,
and the sea is straight ahead, straight up ahead Well it's too bad that our friends, can't be with us today
Well it's too bad
The machine, that we built,
would never save us', that's what they say
(That's why they ain't coming with us today)
And they also said it's impossible for a man to live and breathe under
water, forever,
was the main complaint
And they also threw this in my face, they said:
Anyway, you know good and well it would be beyond the will of God,
and the grace of the King (grace of the King)
(Yeah, yeah) So my darling and I make love in the sand,
to salute the last moment ever on dry land
Our machine, it has done its work, played its part well
Without a scratch on our bodies and we bid it farewell
Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile
Before our heads go under we take a last look at the killing noise
Of the out of style, the out of style, out of style(oooh)... jimi hendrix

Da da da... Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Livin' in a cottage made of earth and wood,
Lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell. Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, strummin' his guitar in the gentle shade,
Playing to the music that the drivers made.
People passing by they'd stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode His mama told him ?someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
All kinds a people coming from miles around
To hear ya play ya guitar 'till the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight. Go, go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Go, Johnny go , go
Johnny B. Goode I am your trash man-
Throw out all your trash today-
Clean out your mind today-
Please pass the weed
And please take some heed.
Take your fast glass guns and
Throw them away.
There he goes, hey
I just the gypsy bandit. Gypsy talk-
She has been here 3 times and
The 4th time, she was emptied in from
The mouth of a bottle.
Seems like I seen you somewhere before-
And her dog named pig had a red
Neck shaped just like a cracker
Dipped in rot hole. Address 3rd trash can from the
Left. that's where I'll be-
Just take all your blues
And throw them at my feet.
-oh that's what friends are for.
Yes I sing the blues for me and you.
Let me do changes and come back
And tell you. so it won't be so hard
When it's time for you to go through. Anything is possible after an
Embarrassing situation- And once you take but all that
Rubbish and hate and-
Load it on my truck.
But don't make me work late-
I am your trashman-
And don't forget I also want
To live- not just survive-
I ain't your black slave- just
Because I just might try to
Wash out your mind- it's up to
Your friend-
To get up off your rusty behind. And please pass me the peace weed,
And take some heed-
Throw all that mixed up speed
Away- all that dirt is gonna clog and
Hurt- man you reach 100 years old in a day-
I am your trashman-
I am your trashman-
I come to keep your houses clean.
I am the trashman-
Take out all your dirty blues and
Dreams-
Well when I come around to
Collect for the bill,
That's when I come around for
My pleasure kill... I am the trashman
You must have seen me in
Your t.v.
I'm here to clean up-
All your hang ups or
Come downs, I'm gonna kill...
That's my duty.
So please don't try to make
Me crawl up no hill. May I whisper in your ear...
Say something you ought to hear...
Lots of people so dear
They're getting hurt... "lady's and gentlemen, the Jimi Hendrix experience." "I see that we meet again hmmm. yeah well, well, well. dig,
Dig, I'd like to get something strait, we umm we got tired
Of the experience, and every once in a while we're blowing
Our minds too much, so we decided to change everything around.
And a call it 'gypsy sons and rainbows' for short nothin' but
A band of gypsies. we have billy cox playin' bass, and um from
Nashville Tennessee we have lary lee playin' guitar over there,
We got juma playin' congos over there, juma, and we have granny
Goose, oh I'm sorry Mitch Mitchell on drums over there, and we
Got jerry velez on congos too. you got yours truly on Pete Whistle,
What me worry? gives us about a minute and a half to tune up ok.
Like we only had about two rehearsals so a we'll only do a primary
Rhythm thing. (someone in the background) I have mine thank you
I have mine thank you, baby." Black is gold is pure
And true kings of this earth. 1. So I say it's up to us to straighten
Out this mess...
We got to go through hell...
And then that's the last of this
Miserable test... 2. Black must be bold
Because it's gold and true
Kings of this world...
So let them go to the moon.
Yes let them go to mars.
Because deep down inside
They're really from the stars. 3. That's why they don't want
Us to mix...just the way
The word of God had said.
So let them go to saturn...that's
Where they'll learn instead.
Because black and white
Together is right...
And white by itself is
An egotistic elf. 4. So they show you how to
Kill...and if you don't
They will.
What do they know about
Happiness...
How can they about life...
They just got lost in space.
So when they landed,
Atlantis cried. So if they're so alone try
To make them feel at home.
So let them fetch you fire wood.
And let them nibble on the bone.
So invent a word called love.
And then they blame our mistakes on god.
Don't you know how lonely they must be.
So many light years from home.
Hey soulful people I'm calling.
Don't be no more slaves.
Because God will protect us
When it comes to doomsday.
Realize before it's too late...
That no one on earth will escape.
We are the kings of earth.
And axis gonna put them slaves...
They killed so many worlds before.
But they will pass sentence upon themselves...
When the earth opens up...will
They be saved from our hell. I feel the truth of life.
We better all realize...
People like me and you
We feel so bad, don't know
What to do... they keep us
High low on drugs.
And they got us making their rugs...
As we go dripping blood.
But the sun knows as
The wind blows and the
Fire grows towards the
Far shores and the water
Foams to make steamed
Bones of all of those who don't belive that...
Black is gold is the kings of this world.
We all better get our places
Before God tells us to our
Face we are...past the human race.
Let's pray that we all agree
We got to straighten out the family tree.
Life is for you and me togather.
That's the way it was meant to be.
White man watch your mouth
Because our drums, they face the south.
And you can't kill the god
That kept you alive between
The poles of the north and south.
You better adjust your place
In this world...before your
Hair, it starts to curl...and the
Yellow, red, and black of this
World will tear your ass and soul apart. Where is he coming from ?
From heaven where 1,000,000
Worlds are one.
Where is he going to ?
He's going to make contact
With the living and the dead...
Here comes black gold...
Gather round young and old...
He's going to be felt by the
Timid and the bold...
Within a wink of an eye, With the wink of an eye
Egos swell, bust and die...
Kingdoms fall and cry...
With the wink of an eye...
With the wink of an eye
A new born baby cries...
And a 100 soldiers die with
The wink of an eye.

Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazley stare at all the millions here
We must have died along, a long long time ago
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world Polly wants a cracker

I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew my meat for you
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you With eyes so dilated, I've became your pupil
You've taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow
I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful
Vacuum out the fluids
Chew my meat for you
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours

They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of July I knew a lady who came from Duluth
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
And she flew away howling on the yellow moon Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of July Now the people cry and the people moan
And they look for a dry place to call their home
And try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils
Fight to claim them for their own Wouldn't you believe it

Was when I learned
To cry on command Love myself
Better than you

What the hell am I trying to say? It is now time
To make it unclear
To write off lines
That don't make a sense Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do? One more special
Message to go

I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To prove I still
Smell her on you Don't, tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowning fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To prove I still
Smell her on you Truth covered in security

Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To make you a deal
We've make a pact
To learn from who
Ever we want
Without new rules
We'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way
To prove they still
Smell her on you
They still, smell her on you
Smell her on you It's so relieving to know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to hear you're asking wherever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me, this is starting to sound the same
I miss the comfort in being sad
In her false withness, we hope you're still with us,
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient,
A display of patience, disease-covered Puget Sound
She'll come back as fire, to burn all the liars,
And leave a blanket of ash on the ground
I miss the comfort in being sad And if you save yourself,
You will make him happy!
He'll keep you in a jar,
And you'll think you're happy...
He'll give you breathing holes,
And you'll think you're happy...
He'll cover you with grass,
And you'll think you're happy... now! You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
Conclusion came to you, ohhh. And if you cut yourself,
You will think you're happy!
He'll keep you in a jar,
Then you'll make him happy...
He'll give you breathing holes,
Then you'll think you're happy...
He'll cover you with grass,
Then you'll think you're happy... now! You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
Conclusion came to you, ohhh. You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
Conclusion came to you, ohhh. And if you fool yourself,
You will make him happy!
He'll keep you in a jar,
Then you'll think you're happy...
He'll give you breathing holes,
Then you will seem happy...
You'll wallow in the shit,
Then you'll think you're happy... now! You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
Conclusion came to you, ohhh... If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
And that's old news Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth? I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
And that's old news Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth? I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me I'm goin' to Hollywood, they'll see that I'm so good
I won't care how I feel, and I'll get to fuck Brooke Shields
I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in I want to be a star, I'm going to have a car
And you'll have to admit, I'll be rich as shit
I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in I would give you some, if you only would have treated me nice
You'll wish that you did, you'll feel pretty stupid
I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in It's fun to be a star, it's nice to have a car
Yeah, you'll have to admit, that I'll be rich as shit
And I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in Teenage angst has paid off well
Now I'm bored and old
Self-appointed judges judge
More than they have sold If she floats than she is not
A witch like we had thought
A down payment on another
One at Salem's lot Serve the servants - oh no
That legendary divorce is such a bore As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead I had a dad I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore
There is nothing I could say
That I haven't thought before Serve the servants - oh no
That legendary divorce is such a bore Mom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed, said please don't go Grandma take me home Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatos and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good She said, well, don't you start your crying
Go outside and ride your bike
That's what I did, I killed my toe After dinner, I had ice cream
I fell asleep and watched TV
I woke up in my mother's arms Grandma take me home
I wanna be alone Come on over
Do the twist (aha)
Overdo it
Have a fit (aha)
Come on over
Shoot the shit (aha)
Love you so much
Makes me sick (aha)
Beat me out of me (beat it, beat it)
She keeps it pumpin' strait in my heart. If you wouldn't mind, I would like it blew
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to lose
If you wouldn't care, I would like to leave
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to breath Is there another reason for your stain
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain
Here is another word that rhymes with shame You could do anything Your life is shit
Shit
Your life is over
Bull
Your life is mine
Cry
Your life is hell
Hell

Dying with you just
I'm going to die

"I'm gonna open myself up a flea market
I'm gonna open myself up a flea market
And you're gonna wish that you did
And retire on the profits
First off
I'm gonna empty out all of my Mrs. Butterworth jars
And I'm gonna put 'em on a shelf with my 800 dollar a month tax free Century 21
Shop And then I am going to put my Mrs. Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups I've accumulated
Over the past 62 years Then I'm going to get some plywood
I'm going to get some plywood and cut them up into two by two piece squares
Then I'm going to get some burlap and I'm going to cut them into two by two
Piece squares and then I'm going to put them onto the pieces of plywood And then I'm going to go to the beach
I'm going to go to the beach and I'm gonna collect some shells and driftwood
And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood and glue them onto the
Plywood and burlap Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
Some belong to strangers and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands There's nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words When you're finished with the mop then you can stop
And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
And the work it took was fun Well the many hands began to scan around for the next plateau
Some said it was in Greenland and some in Mexico
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
But those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they could When I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions Gotta find a way

Follow hate and be me,

Chains from his armor,

Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz? Would you believe me when I do you
You're the queen of my heart
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you

You will make him happy.
He'll keep you in a jar,
And you'll think you're happy.
He'll give you breather holes,
And you'll think you're happy.
He'll cover you with grass
And you'll think you're happy. [Chorus:]
Now...
You're in a laundry room.
You're in a laundry room.
The clues they came to you... And if you cut yourself,
You will think you're happy.
He'll keep you in a jar,
Then you'll make him happy.
He'll give you breather holes,
Then you'll think you're happy.
He'll cover you with grass,
Then you'll think you're happy. [Chorus:Repeat x2] And if you fool yourself,
You will make him happy.
He'll keep you in a jar,
Then you'll think you're happy.
He'll give you breather holes,
Then you will seem happy.
You'll wallow in the shit,
Then you'll think you're happy. [Chorus] Moderate Rock May day, every day, my day
Could've had a heart attack, my heart
We don't know anything, my heart
We all want something fair, my heart Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Out of town, out of sight, is my heart
Queen of lies, today, my heart
One more on the phone, my heart
One more at the door of my heart Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Mean heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart Yeah She should have stayed away from friends
She should have had more time to spend
She should have died when she was born
She should have worn the crown of thorns She should have been a son She should have stood out in the crowd
She should have made her mother proud
She should have fallen on her stance
She should have had another chance Runny nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my fulfill In the someday what's that sound? Broken heart and broken bones
Think of how a castrated horse feels
(Alt: Think about some capsules of horse pills)
One more quirky cliche'd phrase
You're the one I wanna refill In the someday what's that sound? This song is for lovers out there
And the little light in the trees
And all the flowers have gingivitis
And the birds fly happily
We're together once again my love
I need you back oh baby baby
I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl you'll only break my heart...
I can feel it I can hold it I can rub it I can shape it
I can mold it I can cut it I can taste it I can spank it
Beat it
Masturbate it
I been looking for days now
Always hearing the same ol' city boy
Won't you spank through?
I can make you do things you won't think you ever could Hey, I just wanted to know.
Do you like me?
Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starved without your skeleton key I love you for what I am not
I did not want what I have got
Blanket acne'd with cigarette burns
Speak at once while taking turns What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
What do I think? I think Nothing to do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bi-polar opposites attract
All of a sudden my water broke I love you for what I am not
I did not want what I have got
Blanket acne'd with cigarette burns
Second-rate third degree burns What is wrong with me?
What is what I need
What do I think? I think Hate, hate your enemies
Save, save your friends
Find, find your place
Speak, speak the truth What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
What do I think? I think Use just once and destroy

Even if you had a sight

And forests have never grown
It's another light
And I can never have mine It's not mine

Watching out for me
When I can love you
Have your way And she might as well know I
Seem more high
High

I said minerals will make the world
If we did not have chemicals
You would not be writing my death certificate Biting is my friend
My dog left me a sand send
One more day than I can plan
Ends safe from you
Biting ass a lie friend
When I will never have a friend
Biting silent as a man
His silence setting up around And she improvised
And she was supervised
I was a rised
Or arosed
Or a rose
Or a rose
Or aroused
And fine
Fine line
When I
Said night time
When I
Could never kind

If she ever comes down now
Nah
If she comes down now Oh
She looks so good
Oh
She's made out of wood
She says oh Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice Go away - get away, get away, get a-way
Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers I lie in the soll and fertilize mushrooms
Leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume To hope is admittance
Feed before beginning
Double-sided cynics
Reflected image
Don't be so selfish
Leave in me this
Follow it far
To find where you are
You haven't grown
Go on alone
Never finished his sentence
Remained in seclusion
For the next few days
The family circle noose
He had removed us
All the styles of heresy
Finally he appeared unexpectedly
Looking for company I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put in to this
I always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail Pain
Pain
Pain You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let?s talk about someone else
Steaming soup against her mouth
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love herself I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew to come like this Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail Pain
Pain

And it makes your story our concern
And you set it up for returns My opinions. Mmm. Mmm. (x4)
And there seems to be a problem here.
Your state of emotion seems to clear.
You rise and fall like wall street stock
And you had an affect on our happy talk. Our opinions. Mmm. Mmm. (x2)
My opinions. Mmm. Mmm. (x2) Congratulations you have won
It's a years subscription of bad puns.
And it makes your story our concern
And you set it up for returns They lead a lifetime that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make their living off of arts and crafts
They kind with seashells driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground
She loves him more than he will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart They lead a lifetime that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make their living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground
She loves him more than he would ever know
He loves her more than he would ever show Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keep the bitterness close to the heart They lead a lifetime that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make their living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground
She loves her more than he would ever know
He loves her more than he would ever show I am buried up to my neck in
Contradictionary lies
I take pride as the kind of illiterature
I'm very ape and very nice If you ever need anything please don't hesitate
to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naive.
I've seen it all I was here first Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me Don't expect me to cry,
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for me Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me Don't expect me to cry,
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me [Repeat x2]
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for me Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me
Don't expect me to cry,
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for me When I'm feeling tired
She pushed food through the door
And I crawl towards the crack of light
Sometimes I can't find my way
Newspapers spread around
Soaking all that they can
A cleaning is due again
A good hosing down The lady whom I feel maternal love for
Cannot look me in the eyes
But I see hers and they are blue
And they cock and twist and masturbate I said so
I said so
I said so
Nirvana, nirvana, nirvana, nirvana Black windows of paint
I scratched with my nails
I see others just like me
Why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the older ones
They point in my way
They come with a flash of light
And take my family away    
Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Come on, come on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
Come on, come on
Holy Roman empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
You forget so easily
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
I sail to the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost
I was dropped from
Moonbeam
And sailed on shooting stars
Maybe you'll
Be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood
You'll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body
Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body
I'm gonna go to sleep
Let this wash all over me
We don't really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe around, tie him down
We don't want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe around, tie them down
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin
(4, 5, 6, 7)
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down
I can watch and not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone
X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
She's running out again,
She's running out
She's run run run run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your parked car
I am holidays
That you choose to ignore
You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the leaves
I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Because there are no others
You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the leaves
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all right
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Two jumps in a week
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
Kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the once who'll spit at you
You'll be the one screaming out
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing you ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing you have had is gone away
D-don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
I don't want to be your friend
I just want to be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table
Get swept under
Denial, denial
The infrastructure will collapse
Voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband goodnight
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table
And get swept under
Denial, denial
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantoms
I follow to the edge of the earth
And fall off
Everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance
I get eaten by the worms
Weird fishes
Get towed by the worms
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favorite song
As the magic disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back and focus again
The walls abandon shape
You've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the noise
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
What's the point of instruments
Words are a sawed off shotgun
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you start unraveling
Before you take my mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance
Jigsaws falling into place
There is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once
Not just twice
Wish away the nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You've got a light you can feel it on your back
You've got a light you can feel it on your back
Jigsaws falling into place
In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out
Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out
Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder
Someone on your shoulder)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder
Someone on your shoulder)
There there
Why so green and lonely?
And lonely, and lonely?
Heaven sent you to me
To me, to me?
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
Reckoner
You can't take it with yer
Dancing for your pleasure
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all human beings
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
In rainbows
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
Reckoner
Take me with yer
Dedicated to all human beings
[Backing vocals]
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be oh me
The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can
The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can
But now I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want
When I see you messing me around?
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create, that we can
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create
But when I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want
Now I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove and cut me off
And cut me off
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to fill your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
The bird lights float into my room
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
There'll be something missing
And now that you found it
It's gone
Now you feel it you don't
You've gone off the rails
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to Hell
For what your
Dirty mind is thinking
Karma police
Arrest this man
He talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police
Arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo
Is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
Karma police
I've given all I can
It's not enough
I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people, clinging on to bottles
When it comes it's so, so, disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Let down
Let down
Let down
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing, falling
Bouncing back and one day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction (you know where you are)
Hysterical and useless (you know where you are)
Hysterical and (you know where you are)
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
Wears him out
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time
I'll drown my beliefs
To have you be in peace
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living,
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy-kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just don't leave
Don't leave
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And in your life, there comes the darkness
This spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Now we're trapped, we're dark cloud's people
We are helpless to resist
In your darkest hour
But it was just a lie, just a lie
Just a lie, just a lie
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
Still turning heads, you know where it's at
This dread still covers us
You gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, and it's dark now
It was just a laugh, it was just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
Split infinite
And in your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
It's the loudest sound you've ever heard
In your darkest hour
If you had another one
If you had another name
So dark
Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five
I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five
It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now
Because you're not there
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Yeah I feel it, I needed attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Yeah I need it, I needed attention
I needed attention
I needed attention
I needed attention
Yeah I love it, the attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Soon oh
I try to sing along
But the music's all wrong
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not
I'll swallow up flies?
Back and hide
But I'm not
Oh hail to the thief
Oh hail to the thief
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in the box
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not
Oh go up to the king, and the sky is falling in
But it's not
But it's not
Maybe not
Maybe not
How come I end up where I started
How come I end up where I belong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string
How come I end up where I started
How come I end up where I belong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string
You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue
Did your string come undone
One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow
You used to be alright
What happened?
Etcetera etcetera
Facts for whatever
Fifteen steps
Then a shear drop
Please could you stop the noise
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's that?
What's that?
When I am king, you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's that?
What's that?
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing Gucci little piggy
You don't remember
You don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does
Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height
Rain down, rain down (that's it, sir, you're leaving, the crackle of pigskin)
Come on rain down on me (the dust and the screaming, the yuppies networking)
From a great height (the panic, the vomit, the panic, the vomit)
God loves his childrean
God loves his children, yeah
Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return
And it's too late
The damage is done
The damage is done
This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you
A white room
By a window
Where the sun comes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You
Efil ym fo flaH

I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong
Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no
I have no idea what I am talking about
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out
Oh, oh
Make a sound
Move back home
Pale imitation
With the edges
Sawn off
I have no idea what you are talking about
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out
Oh, oh
Has the light gone out for you?
'Cause the light's gone for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
You can fight it like a dog
And they brought me to my knees
They got scared and they put me in
They got scared and they put me in
All the lies run around my face
All the lies run around my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see
I'm alive
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
Oh Maria, come slowly
Come slowly to me
I've been waiting
Patient, patiently
I didn't care but now I can see
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging around for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is you do it to yourself, just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell
You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts
Is you do it to yourself, just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts
Is you do it to yourself just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself, whoa
Say, hey
You do it to yourself, you do it to yourself
Yeah, yeah, you do it to yourself, yes-yes, you
Do it to yourself
Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round up
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing a song on the jukebox that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
Red crosses on wooden doors
And if you float you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
Fade out again
Fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love
When I'm at the pearly gates
This will be on my videotape, my videotape
Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
And I have it all here
In red, blue, green
Red, blue, green
You are my center
When I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
I'm talking to you after it's too late
No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen
This dance
This dance
Is like a weapon
Is like a weapon
Of self defense
Of self defense
Against the present
Against the present
The present tense
I won't get heavy
Don't get heavy
Keep it light and
Keep it moving
I am doing
No harm
As my world
Comes crashing down
I'll be dancing
Freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
I won't turn around at the penny drop
Won't stop now
I won't slack off
Or all this love
Will be in vain
I stop from falling
Down a mine
It's no one's business but mine
Or all this love
Has been in vain
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
I'm lost, I'm a ghost
Dispossessed, taken host
My hunger burns a bullet hole
A spectre of my mortal soul
These rumors and suspicion
Anger is a poison
The only truth that I can see
Is when you put your lips to these
Futures tricked by the past
Spectre, how he laughs
Fear puts a spell on us
Always second-guessing love
My hunger burns a bullet hole
A spectre of my mortal soul
The only truth that I can see
Spectre has come for me
I want to, I want to be someone else or I'll explode.
Floating upon the surface for the birds?, the birds?, the birds?
You want me, well fucking come and find me.
I'll be waiting, with a gun and a pack of sandwiches and nothing, nothing, nothing.
Nothing.
You want me, well come on and break the door down.
You want me, fucking come on and break the door down.
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
Who's in a bunker, who's in a bunker?
Women and children first and the children first and the children
I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow till I burst
Until I burst until I
Who's in a bunker who's in a bunker?
I have seen too much I haven't seen enough
You haven't seen it
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first and the children first and the children
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Ice age coming ice age coming
Let me hear both sides let me hear both sides let me hear both
Ice age coming ice age coming
Throw it in the fire throw it in the fire throw it on the
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening happening
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening happening
Mobiles squearking mobiles chirping
Take the money run take the money run take the money
Here I'm alive (the first of the children)
Everything all of the time (the first of the children)
Here I'm alive (the first of the children)
Everything all of the time (the first of the children)
Here I'm alive (the first of the children)
Everything all of the time (the first of the children)
Here I'm alive (the first of the children)
Everything all of the time (the first of the children)

Hey it's me
I just got off the train
A frightening place
Their faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket
Panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great job, no message coming in
And you're so small
Glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day
The path trails off
And heads down a mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
I don't really care
And the path trails off
And heads down a mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
I don't really care
I feel this often, go
I feel this often, go
It holds us like a phantom
The touch is like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
And we're not at the mercy
Of your shimmerers or spells
Your shimmerers or spells
Mmmhm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
(One day at a time)
One day at a time
We call upon the people
People have this power
The numbers don't decide
Your system is a lie
The river running dry
The wings of a butterfly
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours
One day at a time
You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
But you can take it all back again
Strike up what's in the box
Why should I be good if you're not?
This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
All the good times
All the good times
All the good times
All the good times
All the good times
Take me back again
Take me back
Take me back again
Oh
You really me
Really mess
Ah
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time (ah)
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time (ah)
Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light
Born of a light
The wind rushing round my open heart
An open ravine
In my spirit white
Totally alive
In my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street
To another life
And catching my reflection in a window
Switching on a light
One I didn't know
Totally alive
Totally released
Waking, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Kid A, kid A
Kid A, kid A
Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
Everything
Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
Right place
There are two colors in my head
There are two colors in my head
What is that you tried to say
What is was you tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say
Everything
Everything
Everything
All the holes at once are coming alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind, lonely
And they pray
The ones you light your fires to keep away
Crawling out upon, expending
And all you have to do is say yeah
All the birds stay up in the trees
All the fish swim down too deep lonely
And they pray
Honey, come to me before it's too late
The ones you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon, expelling
And all you have to do is say yeah
One two three four
Wakey wakey
Rise and shine
It's on again, off again, on again
Watch me fall
Like domino's
In pretty patterns
Fingers in the blackbird pie
I'm tingling tingling tingling
It's what you feel now
What you ought to, what you ought to
Reasonable and sensible
Dead from the neck up
Because I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
For no real reason
Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
Take a bow take a bow take a bow
It's what you feel now
What you ought to
What you ought to
An elephant thats in the room is
Tumbling tumbling tumbling
In duplicate and duplicate
Plastic bags and
Duplicate and triplicate
Dead from the neck up
Guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough is enough is enough
I love you but enough is enough, enough
A last stop
There's no real reason
Been thinking about you, your records are here
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
But I'm still no one, and you're now a star
What do you care?
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Should I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself?
What do you care when the other men are far, far better?
All the things you got,
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes,
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey
I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
They don't know what I know
Why should you care when I'm not there?
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Should I still love you, still see you in bed
When I'm playing with myself?
What do you care when I'm not there?
All the things you got
That you'll never need
All the things you got
I'm played out and bleed to please you
Been thinking about you
I jumped in the river, what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
I jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
You bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
You bit me, bit me and I want more
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall
It's all heading south to the Conger Hill
The bangers in the mash, the negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not
Whatever turns you on, whatever gets you up
Chief of Police or Vice Chancellor
Lord and Lady blah blah, the vicar and the judge
You're all dancing to my little red book
Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
I got the poison, poison and now I want more
If you are on the top then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power, we're changing by the hour
If you are on the top then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark the dark will stare back
Back into your soul
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down when I go down
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall
Yeah, because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
The poison, I got the poison, I got the poison now
Yeah, I got the poison
Wake
From your sleep
The drying of
Your tears
Today
We escape
We escape
Pack
And get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before
All hell
Breaks loose
Breathe
Keep breathing
Don't loose
Your nerve
Breathe
Keep breathing
I can't do this
Alone
Sing
Us a song
A song to keep
Us warm
There's
Such a chill
Such a chill
You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your
Rules and wisdom choke you
Now
We are one
In everlasting peace
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope
That you choke
That you choke
Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with why
I'm moving out of orbit
(Turning in somersaults)
Turning in somersaults
(A giant turtle's eyes)
A giant turtle's eyes
(And jellyfish float by)
And jellyfish float by
(It's what keeps me alive)
That there
That's not me
I go
Where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah it's gone
And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes
I'm not here
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
Bloom
Open your mouth wide
The universe will sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does it still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with whys
I'm moving out of orbit
Turning in somersaults
A giant turtle's eyes
As jellyfish float by
Morning Mr. Magpie
You got some nerve coming here
You got some nerve coming here
You stole it all
Give it back
You stole it all
Give it back
Good morning Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
And took my memory
You know you should
But you don't
You know you should
But you don't
Good morning Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
Took my melody
Little By Little
Turned so nasty now
The dark's there
The pillar of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell
Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
Once you've been around you've been around enough
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged
I don't know where it is I should look
You could want it all, the flag and pole
I'm curling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal
Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
A job that's killing you
Killing you
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged
I don't know where it is I should look
Little by little by hook or by crook
I am such a tease, and you're such a flirt

Lotus Flower
I would shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I would shrink and I would disappear
I would slip into the groove
And cut me up
And cut me up
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I'll set you free
Slowly we unfold
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast-ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We would shrink and then be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I'll set you free
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
just to see what if
Just to see what is
The bird that's flown into my room
Slowly we unfold
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast-ballooning head
Listen to your heart
Codex
Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Flying to our side
No one gets hurt
You've done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent
Give Up The Ghost
Don't haunt me
Don't hurt me
Gather up the lust and soul
In your arms
Gather up the pitiful
In your arms
What seems impossible
In your arms
I think I have had my fill
In your arms
I think I should give up the ghost
In your arms
Separator
it's like i've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
the sweetest flowers and fruits were hanging from the trees
falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me
it's like i've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I've my heart in my mouth
It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the Beholder
I'm a fish now, out of water
Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me
I fell open, I lay under
At the tea parlour
I lost your number
And once it's over
Hid back under
If you think this is over, then you're wrong
If you think this is over, then you're wrong
If you think this is over, then you're wrong
If you think this is over, then you're wrong
It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
Wake me up
Genie let out the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Murderers you're murderers
We are not the same as you
Genie let out the bottle
Funny ha ha funny how
When the walls bend
When the walls bend
With your breathing
With your breathing
When the walls bend
When the walls bend
With your breathing
With your breathing
With your breathing
They will suck you down
To the other side
They will suck you down
To the other side
They will suck you down
To the other side
They will suck you down
To the other side
To the shadows blue and red
Shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells
Your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red
Shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells
Your alarm bells
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
This is the gloaming
Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen from my life support
My iron lung
We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are loosing it, can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
Iron lung
Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out we'll just hum
This this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time
My iron lung
If you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
If you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
Flies are buzzing round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can?
The best you can is good enough
If you try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one dropped a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on animal farm
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
If you try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Ah ah ah
Oh oh oh
I'd really like to help you, man
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionettes
Floating around on a prison ship
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
Ah ah ah (oh oh oh)
Ah ah ah (oh oh oh)
Ah ah ah
Oh oh oh
Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk
And I can't face the evening straight
And you can't offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, believe, believe, believe
And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen
'Cause I can't face the evening straight
And you can't offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, believe, believe, believe
It's too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best when the light is off
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die
And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling
That either way he turns
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
You are the sun the moon and stars
Are you and I could never run away from you
You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you
It's like the world is gonna end so soon
And why should I believe myself?
Yeah
You, me, and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see you drowning
Caught in the fire
You, me, and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see you drowning
Caught in the fire
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin
(4, 5, 6, 7)
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down
I can watch and not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone
X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change
Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
The head of state has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
We are standing on the edge
Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing I miss you
Snakes and ladders flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knives you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance you fucker dance you fucker
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face
Take it with the love its given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the tax man
Let me back
Let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror at the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
Walking like giant cranes
And with my X-ray eyes I strip you naked
In a tight little world
And are you on the list?
Stepford wives who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers
Investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers city
Boys in first class don't know we're born just know
Someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
I wish you'd get up get over
Get up get over and turn the tape off
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
They love me like I was their brother
They protect me
Listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine
Made me happy
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
I call up my friend the good angel
But she's out with
Her answer-phone
She says she'd love to come help but
The sea would
Electrocute us all
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough
Nice dream, if you think you belong enough
Nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough
Nice dream, if you think you belong enough
Now come home
Now come home
Now come home
Now come home
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends
He said,
I been where I liked
I slept with who I liked
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now
I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating
Like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used as a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon
I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
Don't know why I feel so skinned alive
My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and salivate
Like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you
Should put me down
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
Yeah no one likes a smart arse
But we all like stars
That wasn't my intention
I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up
Strangled beaten up
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied
Get yourself together
Let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath
Pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without warning
Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup?
Down is the new up
Is the new up
Won't you be my girl?
Won't you be my girl?
Your services
Are not required
Your future's bleak
You're so last week
Ladies and gentlemen
Without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate
I shall now contort
Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flop?
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Is the new up
You crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us
All on candid camera
The chink in your armour
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town
Shake your pockets out
Pass it on
Pass it down
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town
I want to see you smile again
Like diamonds in the dust
The amazing sound of the killing hordes
The day the banks collapse on us
Cease this endless chattering
Like everything is fine
When sorry is not good enough
Sit in the back while no-one drives
So glad, so glad you're mine
So glad, so glad you're mine
So glad, so glad you're mine
So glad, so glad you're mine
I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on
I used to think
I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think
Start again begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never go back
Never go back
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?
Open up, let me in
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Come back
Come back
Ah, ah
Ah
I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my mouth
I'm not coming back
So knives out
Cut him up
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth
If you'd been a dog
They would have drowned you at birth
Look into my mouth
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth
So knives out
Cut him up
Squash his head
Put him in the pot
I want you to know
He's not coming back
His blood is frozen
Still there is no point letting it go to waste
So knives out
Catch the mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the pot
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
Fade out again
Fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love
You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
If you could take it all back again
Rows and rows of enemies
I'd love to set you free
I bet you really miss me
This is a foul tasting medicine
This is a foul tasting medicine
You really messed up this time
You just ain't got the message yet
Still trapped in your full stop
You messed up everything
The truth will mess you up
The good times
Take me back home again
Take me back home again
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now?
When I need you
Alone on an airplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood will thicken
I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared
That there's nothing underneath
And who are my real friends
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking
This slow
My baby's got the bends
Oh, no
We don't have any real friends
No, no, no
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
And I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the C.I.A
The tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
To blow me sky-high
Baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would-
I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race
I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race, race, race?
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird, where are you now?
When I need you
Slight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasize
No one gets hurt
You've done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent
I want to
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floatin' upon this surface for the birds
The birds
The birds
You want me?
Fuckin' well, come and find me
I'll be waitin'
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches
And nothin'
Nothin'
Nothin'
You want me?
Well, come and break the door down
You want me?
Fuckin' come and break the door down
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready,
I'm ready
I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
The troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you
What am I coming to?
I'm gonna melt down
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
This is killing me
This is killing me
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Gather up the lost and sold (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
Gather up the pitiful (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
What seems impossible (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
I think I have had my fill (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
I think I should give up the ghost (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
I will
Lay me down
In a bunker
Underground
I won't let this happen
To my children
Meet the real-world coming
Out of your shell
With white elephants
Sitting ducks
I will
Rise up
Little baby's eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
In the next world war
In a jack knifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
Fitter, happier
More productive
Comfortable
Not drinking too much
Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient, better driver
A safer car, baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
No paranoia
Careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall
Favours for favours, fond but not in love
Charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash, also on sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace, slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness
Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig in a cage on antibiotics
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
She's running out again,
She's running out
She's run run run run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
You don't wanna talk to me,
You don't wanna say the words,
You try to get off the hook,
You try to get off the hook.
Sprawling on a pin,
Hanging off the hook,
Trying to get yourself away,
Trying to get yourself away.
There's no use dwelling on,
On what might have been,
Just think of all the fun,
You could be having.
We know the way you talk,
We know what you want,
We know what you want,
What you really wanted.
Take a look around,
There's candles on the cake,
On what might have been,
The road you should have took,
Mistakes mistaken
There's no use dwelling on,
No use dwelling on.
It's such a beautiful day,
It's such a beautiful day,
Find yourself a ????,
Go and get some rest.
It's such a beautiful day.
It's such a beautiful day.
Go up to the mic,
Go up to the mic,
Go and get some rest.
The breath of the morning
I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town
Where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet
For cracks in the pavement
Up above
Aliens hover
Making home movies
For the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures
Who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves
And live for their secrets
They're all
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Oh
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be alright
Alright
I'm alright
Alright
I'm just
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on
It's holding on
Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
Wish that I could come out of the fog
Superhero powers
Burst out of the sand
in a bunch of flowers
you just say the word, apparition comes
with a long and winning handsome smile
wish we could connect
Step into the fog
of the diving board
blend into the light
down the cable lines
roll onto the earth
reforming on the wind
two places at once
taste the air with you
undo all the ties
wish that I could flip one of those lies
lift us on the wind
see that stretchy smile
go
Right across your
Face
