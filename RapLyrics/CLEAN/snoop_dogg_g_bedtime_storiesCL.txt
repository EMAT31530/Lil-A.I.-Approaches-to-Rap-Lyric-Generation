(Could you read us a bedtime story?) 
Alright, alright. 
Ya'll get my ash tray, get my lighter. 
I'm a read ya'll a gangsta bedtime story. 
Come here, sit on my lap. 
(Okay.)
Check it out.

Great scotts, it's hot today
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air
His vision gettin blurry but you know I didn't care
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck
So I ran up on this ninja and I shot him in his neck
Shooting like a muthafrickin vietnam vet
Riding on this ninja disrepectin my set
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots
On the hood gettin hot, anybody can drop
You better have a spot up in town my ninja
Cause please believe it, it can go down my ninja
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat
Grease strikes you out with no get back
Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat 
And your b***** ain't poop the little homie hit that
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me
Let's go get a stick ninja dip with me
We can ride on some ninjas for nuthin at all
Even if we cool with 'em, frick 'em let's go get 'em
LBC in this muthafricka cuz
I had to show these ninjas what time it was
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns 
We claiming everything ninja, even dimes and doves
Have you ever slapped a b***** to mack your grip
Or better yet, strapped a clip 
To a muthafrickin' nine millimeter for heater 
And put the ride down out of G two seater
You need a ninja like me to get your game like that
Young ninja, you could get a smack for that
I'm that ninja who brought the afro back 
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack
Before I came out ninjas was wearing slack
I brought the curl back and the golf hat
The black poker sack and this skandelous raps
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks
I brought snaps to the game ninja
Raps to the game ninja, I'm that big rap name ninja
S-N double O-P fa sho
I do my thang way cut throat on the downlow
Oh once upon a time in the LBC
There lived a OG from the DPG
And all the little kids looked up to him
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel
And all they hated on him because he was way to real
I don't know why but he's just so fly
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight
