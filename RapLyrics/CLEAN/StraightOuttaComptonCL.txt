ou are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

Verse One: Ice Cube

Straight outta Compton, crazy motherfricker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggaz With Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if ya frick with me
The police are gonna hafta come and get me
Off yo ass, that's how I'm goin out
For the punk motherfrickers that's showin out
Niggaz start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
Goin off on a motherfricker like that
with a gat that's pointed at yo ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no tellin when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep yo dancin
with a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act the motherfrickin fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knockin ninjaz out tha box, daily
yo weekly, monthly and yearly
until them dumb motherfrickers see clearly
that I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy you can't frick with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
Coz Ice Cube is crazy as frick
As I leave, believe I'm stompin
but when I come back, boy, I'm comin straight outta Compton

Chorus:

[City of Compton, City of Compton]

[Eazy E] Yo Ren
[MC Ren] Whassup?
[Eazy E] Tell em where you from!

Verse Two: MC Ren

Straight outta Compton, another crazy bum ninja
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfricker and you know this
But the p**sy bum ninjaz don't show this
But I don't give a frick, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jackin the crops
Just like burglary, the definition is 'jackin'
And when illegally armed it's called 'packin'
Shoot a motherfricker in a minute
I find a good piece o' p**sy, I go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'm a call you a b***** or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a b***** is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're composed to
a crazy muthafricker from tha street
Attitude legit cause I'm tearin up poop
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb muthafricker that starts static
Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself 
every time I pull a AK off the shelf 
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw
See, coz I'm the motherfrickin villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin
that's takin place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your bum is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
but a ninja like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton...

Chorus:

[City of Compton, City of Compton]

[Dr. Dre] Eazy is his name and the boy is comin...

Verse Three: Eazy-E

...straight outta Compton
is a brotha that'll smother yo' mother
and make ya sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfricker raises hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See, I don't give a frick, that's the problem
I see a motherfrickin cop I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showin a ninja drivin
but don't know where the frick he's going, just rollin
lookin for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they never seize me
Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark
except when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation
and hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin
So what about the b***** who got shot?  frick her!
You think I give a damn about a b*****?  I ain't a sucker!
This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever frick with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother
word to the motherfricker, straight outta Compton

Chorus:

[City of Compton, City of Compton]

[Damn that poop was dope!]
