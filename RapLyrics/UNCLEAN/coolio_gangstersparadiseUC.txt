[Verse One]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nuttin left
Cause I've been blastin and laughin so long that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin, and where you walkin
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin prayers in the street light

[Chorus: L.V.]
We've been spending most our lives
Living in the Gangsta's Paradise
	(repeat)
We keep spending most our lives
Living in the Gangsta's Paraside
	(repeat)

[Verse Two]
Look at the situation, they got me facin
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the strict
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin got me chasin dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'ed out gangsta, set-trippin banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nuthin but a heartbeat away
I'm livin life do-or-die-a, what can I say?
I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-fo'?
The way things is goin I don't know

[Interlude: L.V.]
Tell me why are we -- so blind to see 
That the ones we hurt -- are you and me

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin, but half of them ain't lookin
It's goin on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin
They say I got ta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they cain't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they cain't -- I guess they won't
I guess they front; that's why I know my life is outta luck, fool

[Chorus]

[Outro: L.V.]
Tell me why are we -- so blind to see 
That the ones we hurt -- are you and me
Tell me why are we -- so blind to see 
That the ones we hurt -- are you and me
