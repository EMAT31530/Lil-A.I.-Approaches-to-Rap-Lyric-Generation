Que tengo muy cerca para ver tu cara todos los días Contigo es donde
yo prefiero estar
pero estamos atrapados en esto
Y es tan difícil
Estás tan lejos
Esta distancia me está matando
Me gustaría que estuvieras aquí conmigo
pero estamos atrapados en esto.
Y es tan difícil
Estás tan lejos
Esta distancia me está matando Es tan difícil
Es tan difícil

se sienten como horas
y las horas se sienten como días
Aunque estoy lejos
tu sabes que
no puedo estar en casa
pero vuelvo a casa pronto
vuelvo a casa pronto. Todo lo que tengo es esta foto en un marco
Que tengo muy cerca para ver tu cara todos los días
Contigo es donde
yo prefiero estar
pero estamos atrapados en esto
Y es tan difícil
Estás tan lejos
Esta distancia me está matando
Me gustaría que estuvieras aquí conmigo
pero estamos atrapados en esto.

que puedo cantar para pasar el tiempo... ¿Qué estás loco?
Se está haciendo difícil esperar,
Estoy tratando de hacerle ver,
Que ella no sabe realmente
Que yo estoy tratando de encontrar una manera,
Y dile a ella todos los días, que sólo va de la mano
Así que ...
Yo no quiero ser,
El único que sabe
Que alguien podría venir y apenas
Dicen que el amor por mí,
Estoy de pie temblando de tierra,
Y estoy pensando que voy a perder, Estribillo:
Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. ¿Estás hablando conmigo?
Ya estoy atrapado. Me gustaría que me podía ver,
Pero es que lo que
Siente esto debe ser.
Mi amor es como bala
Todo lo que necesita es una inyección para mí para hacer estallar todo por la borda.
No quiero sentir que estoy perdiendo el tiempo,
Va a estar con ustedes y nadie más.
Hasta que me aviso,
Necesito saber en este momento
Porque yo he estado creo que me voy a perder Estribillo:
Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Dame una oportunidad ...
Pero chica que me pone nervioso,
A estas alturas ya debería haberme dado cuenta.
¿Y qué va a tomar
Para la celestial ...
Me estás volviendo loco! Estribillo:
Porque yo estoy perdiendo mi cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo el control de mí mismo esta vez.
Ella me tiene de perder la cabeza,
Estoy perdiendo mi mente,
Estoy perdiendo a mi manera,
Pero yo creo que ella siente que ya estoy atrapado. Hey, hey, hey

More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh, how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it Look at me when I'm talkin' to you
You looking at me but I'm lookin' through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself I'm looking at the Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you re all alone
And you correct me when I'm lookin' wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pain
I see the scars that remain
I see you Wayne, I'm lookin' at the Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again Lookin' at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my fuckin' dad
Light it up, that's smoke at mirrors

I see my momma smile that's a blessin'
I see the change, I see the message
And no message could been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the Mirror on the wall, (MJ taught me that)
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall

Faced again with the same mistakes
So stubborn, thinking I know what is right
But life proves me wrong every time Taking roads that lead me no where,
How do I expect to get there
But when will I learn to just put you first I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong, cause only with you
Can I move on (can I move on) When I'm weak, it's you that makes me strong
And I know that you've been with me all along
So many times I forget to close my eyes
And listen to my heart
With you, life is so easy
Why do I make it hard Oh, taking roads that lead me no where,
How do I expect to get there
When will I learn to just put you first I, I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong, cause only with you
Can I move on I'll get out of my own way,
Let you have your way
Cause I realized I'm no good on my own
I'm there for you, I'll serve for you
I can't live without you I come to you now when I need you
Why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong,
With only you, only you, with only you
Can I move on, can I move on, can I move on Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe And then here we are (here we are), in this big old empty room
Staring at each other, who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute, and now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go is all the way Oh babe, Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl no need to be nervous,
'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing no, no, no,
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time Clothes are not required, for what we got planned
Ooh, girl your my desire, your wish is my command
Treat you like a princess, ooh girl your so delicious
Like ice cream on a sunny day, gonna eat you before you melt away, yeah Oh babe, Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl no need to be nervous, no, no, no,
'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing no, no, no,
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time [Chorus]

Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye Yeah, I'm still in love with you darlin'

Oh, what's the point of both of us being broken hearted?
I pray it's never too late So tell me, why, why can't we try and start again?

It's unfair, she's out there Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn Little miss perfect sitting at the train stop
Red Nike high tops listening to hip-hop

Twenty one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn On the street kickin' rocks circling the same block
Green farm flat bush checking every corner shop
Tappin' people's shoulders askin' if they know her
Everyday's the same back to the train (uh) next stop Brooklyn

So take a breath leave me and
Was so scared of you leaving
Wish we could both just run Wish we could run it off
But we can't stop time
Seems the clock is running too fast
And now i'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait
Wait wait wait for you oh Our phone calls will have to do
Write you letters just to prove
You're the only thing on my mind
I know it's hard but we'll get through
Just hold on I promise you
Soon you'll be here by my side
But we can't stop time
Seems like the clock is running way too fast
And now i'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait
Wait wait wait for you oh See you down there everyday
Trying to find a different way
To build some kind of ladder to the sky Trying to find some way to see
Secrets of eternity, and they don't come all at once
And you don't know why Well how do you think it feels to hear you screaming out my name
While all the while I'm trying to open up your heart
See you when you cry yourself to sleep
It's tearing me apart I know you wish you could see me
That's the way it has to be
Someday you'll understand,
Don't you lose your faith in me I know you wish you could hear me
Sometimes it's so hard to do
But every morning sunrise it says
I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you I know that you're waiting for,
A chance to come in from the war
If only a moment, if only a day A place where you feel safe and warm
A sanctuary from the storm
Until all of these questions fade away But I cannot count on all the signs
You've passed away as mere coincidence
And I'm running out of ways to break through
Like a lonely lover, Waiting by the ocean
I'll never give up on you I know you wish you could see me
That's the way it has to be
Someday you'll understand,
Don't you lose your faith in me I know you wish you could hear me
Sometimes it's so hard to do
But every morning sunrise it says
I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you
Yes I'm madly in love with you I got too many girls on hold for you to be so bold
Too many on my team for you to act so mean
You say you wanna go and have fun, well you ain't the only one
If I ring, don't let it ring too long or I'm gone I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the eesha's waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin', playa hatin'
If this is how it's gonna be? I'm calling all my lovelies (calling all my lovelies)
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me)
Oh, look what you making me do Honey pie, I'm far too fly to be on standby
Sendin' me straight to voicemail, suga, what the hell?
Oh, you ought to be ashamed, playin' these childish games
I don't get down like that, tell me where you at, hit me back I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the eesha's waitin' on me

Oh no, look at what you started, baby
Now I'm left here brokenhearted, baby
There's a pain in my chest I cannot explain

So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Don't speak boy just listen
Before we go down this road Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Aint no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Wish I could stay all night
But I just can't tonight
Cause I gotta be up at 6
Boy you made my heart melt
When you undid my seatbelt
And told me to come give you a kiss So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Don't speak boy just listen
Before we go down this road
[ Lyrics from:
Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Aint no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Something about you makes me wanna drive all night all night all night long
I can't wait when till the next time I see you (uh) home home Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Aint no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home Your telling me aint no rush to stay there's no delay oh oh

Just take me the long way home Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
ah babe ah baby just take me the long way home Oh I never done this before
Never wanna do this again
Long turn on a dusty road
I did it to myself so I can't pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good God I must've been blind
'Cause she got me for everything, everything, everything, alright
Like my daddy I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little miss snake eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her door
'Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma oh Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run The good lord better bless your soul
'Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, please please please
And now I look at you, and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me, cry for me all night
I spend my lifetime in jail (yeah that's what I do)
I'll be smiling in my cell (yeah thinking bout you)
Can't nobody save you now
So there ain't no use in trying
Once I get my hands on you, I'ma oh Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run I should've known better (I should've known better)
'Cause when we were together ('Cause when we were together)
She never said forever (She never said forever)
I'm a fool that played her game Hey, Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well I'm digging a ditch for this gold-digging bitch
Watch out she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her tell her I'm coming
She better run Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day baby
While I hide from the sun It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like
Until you try You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,
Waiting on the other side We would live forever
Who could ask for more
You could die if you wanted
But baby what for It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like
Until you try You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,
Waiting on the other side If they say life's a dream
Call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland
It damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line
You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster
But I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly
I've been feeling insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
Cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we pay when we living on the other side You know I, I'll be waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole life time
But you just gotta decide
You know I, I'll be waiting on the other,
Waiting on the other side It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand

The day has come at last
Our precious jewel has returned
I'll be the first to say welcome back
Oh welcome back I say welcome, welcome, welcome
Back Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me "Do I look okay? "
I say When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are Yeah Oh, i was perfect
For the circus
if she dared me, i do it
Love makes you stupid
i gave it up, But i guess it was not enough
Cause she never seemed satisfied
(Oohh)
i Know i'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is ?
(Oohh)
she wanted someone that's perfect
Well Okay
But can you tell me Who is ?
Oohh x2 she set the bar
Just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it
But i still kept on reaching
she watched me try
At least a thousand times
If she loved me, She'd stop me But noo
(Oohh)
i Know i'm not perfect
But at the end of the day
Who is ?
(Oohh)
she wanted someone that's perfect
Well Okay
But can you tell me Who is ?
I saw something worth my future
So wrong So wrong
In my mind i was all it took
But i guess i wasn't wrong
(Oohh)

But at the end of the day
Who is ?

It's getting hard to breathe
I'm trying to make her see,
That she don't really know
That I'm trying to find a way,
And tell her every day, that she just goes along
So I...
I don't wanna be,
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Take her right from me
I'm standing shaking ground,
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it, Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost. I'm already lost. I wish that I could see,
What is making you
Feel that you should be concerned.
My love is like a gunshot
All it takes is one shot for me to blow it all away.
I don't wanna feel like I'm just wasting time,
It's gotta be with you and no one else.
Do you notice me,
I need to know right now
Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost. Maybe I'm trying too hard
But girl you make me nervous,
By now you should have noticed me.
And what will it take it
To a heavenly because your
drawing chains and
driving me insane! Chorus:
Girl,I'm losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing control of myself this time.
She's got me losing my head,
I'm losing my mind,
I'm losing my way,
But I think she feels I'm already lost. Hands over my head thinking
What else could go wrong
Would've stayed in bed
How could a day be so long? Never believe that things
Happen for a reason
But how this turned out
Removed all my doubt so believe That for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you I missed the first train stood out
In the rain all day
(Little did I know)
But I caught the next train
And there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for Never believed that things
Happen for a reason
But how this turned out
Removed all my doubt So believe that for you
I'd do it all over again, do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again Oh, who ever thought a day gone
So wrong could turn out so lovely
Yeah, I'm so glad I found you
Even though the day went so wrong
I wouldn't change a thing Yeah, yeah, I'ma do it
Do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again Do it all over again, I'd do it all over again
I'd do all over again for you
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely Everyday I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh, how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Once again you're home alone
Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that you're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby Everyday same old things
So used to feelin pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows You've been livin this way so long
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one your looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see Everyday same old things
So used to feelin pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know
It can
I'll undress you, 'cause you're tired
Cover you as you desire
When you fall asleep inside my arms
May not have the fancy things
But I'll give you everything
You could ever want, it's in my arms So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight
So baby tell me yes

About a million reasons I bow down to pray

To cut through all his worn out leather

But baby, I just need one good one to stay Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather

About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me there's (Something), something, something about this place
(Something), something about lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about baby you and I It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart On my birthday you sang me a heart of gold
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me there's (Something), something, something about this place
(Something), something about lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy

There's only three men that I am a certain my whole life
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ (Something), something, something about the chase (six whole years)
I am a New York woman born to rock you down
So want my lipstick all over your face

Last night when we were alone
You threw your arms up
Baby you gave up, you gave up I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke? I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
All my bubble dreams, bubble dreams I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye And I know that it's complicated
But I'm a loser in love
So baby raise a glass to mend
All the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends I'll never talk again

Juda-as! Juda-ah-as! Judas! Ga-ah ga-ah When he calls to me, I am ready

(Last night) Our lovers quarrel (I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say (And it was kind of dirty)
Oh my (And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here! (It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here! (It was kind of trashy)
Cause I can't help my mind from going there! [Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do...
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you [Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (don't stop the party)
Making love in my sex dreams (4x) [Verse 2]
We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought (cause I'm broken)
Let's white- (by the one before) glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
Help me here!
(And I feel so trashy)
Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads! [Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do...
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you [Chorus 2]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my Sexxx dreams
Don't stop the party (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Let's keep it naughty (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, Tomorrow when I run into you [Bridge]
You could turn a stone
Or the color of a man petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him [Speaking]
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks
And oh my god
(*vomits and giggles*) [Chorus 3]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (you were in my)
Last night
Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams)
Let's keep it naughty (Doing really nasty things)
Watch me act a fool (Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you (Making love in my Sexxx dreams) [iTunes Festival Bridge]
We were in the swimming pool. I was naked, so were you, and I wrote this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies and now's the time for the trial with doubts and drawls
(I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple of drinks and, oh my god-- [laughs]) Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Does it seem we have even make sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me So I said, "I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight, tonight" So I just packed my baggage and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took the road to nowhere on my own Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home And I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see world together

Said, "Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple.
It's the way that you love and treat your mother" Thought that I would be alone forever
But I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home
But I think with you I can spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rear view and fire up the jets

Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion) (Where are you, 'cause I can't see you)
It was a perfect illusion (but I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy)
(Where are you, 'cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
(But I feel you watchin' me)
Illusion (but I feel you watchin' me)
Mistaken for love (where are you 'cause I can't see)

Mistaken for love (dilated, falling free in a modern ecstasy)
Mistaken for love
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy I'm over the show

It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love

You were so perfect
You were a, you were a perfect illusion It's like, I just love a cowboy you know
I'm just like, I just, I know, it's bad
But I'm just like
Can I just like, hang off the back of your horse
And can you go a little faster?! Three am, Mustang speedin'
Two lovers, headed for a dead end
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, prayin'
On the moonlight Every john is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Baby let's get high, John Wayne Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission
One, two ya, the gears are shiftin'
He called, I cried, we broke
Racin' through the moonlight Every john is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Baby let's get high, John Wayne So I go to the eye
Of the storm
Just to feel your love
Knock me over
Here I go
Into our love storm Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Baby let's get high, John Wayne Last night
(Our lovers quarrel)
I was thinking about you
(More than I can say)
And it was kind of dirty
(All night)
And the way that you looked at me
(Help me here)
It was kind of nasty
(Help me here)
It was kind of trashy
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed I touch myself and think of you Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought ('cause I'm broken)
Let's white (by the one before) glove the bed
(He was kinda nasty) Help me here
'Cause I feel so trashy
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our head Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place
Heard that we both got nothing to do
And I lay in bed I touch myself and I think of you Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams You could turn a stone
Or the color of a man petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him I can't believe I'm telling you this but
I've had a couple of drinks and oh my god Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)

Hey yo You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay Young, wild, American
Lookin' to be somethin'

Through all the tears and all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright Just give in don't give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me Just know when that glass is empty

Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way saying forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For something he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothing more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece from Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for getting what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off
I get on my knees and beg you Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold I can carry you, but not your ghosts
Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold (Verse 1:)
Hey babe,

I'm looking for someone that can handle me.
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so.

You and me were kind of in complete.
Need someone to say me he loveth me. Give it up
Put it up

Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do A rush at the beginning

I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm nineteen and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing I'm alright
It's just another graceless night Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night, 'cause All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway? (Go back and tell it) Please could you be tender and I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you 'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well I guess I should go
Yeah I guess I should go Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed you when you told me this was my ho-o-ome I light all the candles
Got flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
The waves come after midnight
I call from underwater
Why even try to get right?
When you've outgrown a lover
The whole world knows but you
It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed you when you told me this was my ho-o-ome Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak
It was real for me, yup, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day 'til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything, how we'd drift buying groceries
How you'd dance for me
I'll start letting go of little things 'til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah "What is this tape?"
"This is my favorite tape" Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Well guess why? I like that
'Cause I kinda miss your life fucked
Kinda wanna tape my mouth shut
Look out, lovers We're L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S
Generation

Generation
L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S Break the news, you're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I've stopped needing you Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In the torn up town, no post code envy But every song's like:
Gold teeth
Grey Goose
Tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains
Ball gowns
Trashing the hotel room We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams But everybody's like:
Crystal
Maybach
Diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes
Islands
Tigers on a gold leash We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money But every song's like:
Gold teeth
Grey Goose
Tripping in the bathroom
Bloodstains
Ball gowns
Trashing the hotel room We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams But everybody's like:
Crystal
Maybach
Diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes
Islands
Tigers on a gold leash We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy ooh ooh oh ooh
We're better than we've every dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen ooh ooh oh ooh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us, we crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar Those great whites, they have big teeth
Oh, they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you, ever, I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it 'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you All those rumors, they have big teeth
Oh, they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you, ever, I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it 'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Yes, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fire
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it And our people talk to me, but nothing ever hits
So people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm going in (ooh) This is the start of how it all ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We rip the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart I dream all year, but they're not the same kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone that ever laid a finger on me
I'm going in (ooh) This is the start of how it all ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We rip the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat Wait 'til you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room Dancing around the lies we tell
Dancing around big eyes as well, ah
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell [Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
So there So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release [Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there [Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team We're on each other's team
And you know we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know and you know and you know (One, two) Baby really hurt me
Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands
Play at romance, we slow dance
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting
Running through the night, but
Every perfect summer's
Eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone They're gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun Limelight
Lose my mind
Limelight
Lose my mind
Limelight
Lose my mind
Limelight Oh god, I'm clean out of air in my lungs
It's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move along with the truth
Ooh (hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see every
Ribbon you used to tie yourself to me But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me? King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care (but what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober? Oh God, I'm closing my teeth
Around this liquor, wet
Limelight, lose my mind
I know you're feeling it too
Can we keep up with the ruse?
Ah ah (hey)
B-bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart
Jack and Jill got fucked up and possessive
When they get dark But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me? King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober?
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care (but what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with the fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
But what will we do when we're sober? Midnight, we're fading
'Till daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache
And the treason, the fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
Oh, dancing with us, oh, you'll be dancing with us
(Can you feel it, can you, can you)
Dancing with us, us (but what will we do when we're sober?) When you get to my high (limelight, lose my mind)
When you get to my (limelight, lose my mind) A couple rebel top gun pilots
Flying with nowhere to be
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lines
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right? Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite Might get your friend to drive, but he can hardly see
We'll end up painted on the road
Red and chrome
All the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Hands under your t-shirt
Know I think you're awesome, right? Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Now you know it's really gonna blow Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm nineteen and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing I'm alright
It's just another graceless night Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night, 'cause All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway? Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it Our thing progresses, I call and you come through
Blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
But we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the Louvre
Down the back, but who cares, still the Louvre Okay I know that you are not my type (still I fall)
I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (but what about love?)
Nothing wrong with it, supernatural
Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
And make 'em all dance to it (Go back and tell it) Please could you be tender and I will sit close to you

I'll find a way to be without you, babe In my head, I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
I'm someone you maybe might love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it
To just a supercut 'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours (are the moments I play in the dark)
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
Slow motion, I'm watching our love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

Because ours (are the moments I play in the dark)
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart In my head, I do everything right
In my head, I do everything right Don't you think that it's boring how people talk
Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasing a million things I want
And I am only as young as the minute is full of it
Getting pumped up from the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me (yeah) Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah) Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Everything's cool when we're all in line, for the throne
But I know it's not forever (yeah) Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah) It looked alright in the pictures (yeah) Getting caught soft with the triple is it
I fall apart, with all my heart
And you can watch from your window
And you can watch from your window Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah) And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah) I'm in a clique but I want out
It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days there was enough
The card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood
I was in but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
You'll get punched for the love club
For the love club I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill make it too ill
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sitting pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want
Except to be alone Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
You'll get punched for the love club
For the love club Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
When you're a member go on your great adventure again
They will be waiting at the end Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
You'll get punched for the love club
For the love club There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean And the cry goes out (ha)
They lose their minds for us, and how it plays out (ha)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious Delicate in every way but one (the swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old way)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us And the cry goes out (ha oh)
They lose their minds for us and how it plays out (ha oh)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold lie promises,
We'll always win at this, I don't ever think about death
It's alright if you do, it's fine
We gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain,
"Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?"
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
No post code envy But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy (Ooh ooh oh)
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen
(Ooh ooh oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
Well you laughed, baby it's okay
It's buzz cut season anyway
(Well you laughed, baby it's okay) Explosions on TV, and all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool, where everything is good We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays) The men up on the news, they try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue, where everything is good And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us Explosions on TV, and all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool, where everything is good And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old I want them back
I want them back
The minds we had
The minds we had
How all the thoughts
How all the thoughts
Moved 'round our heads
Moved 'round our heads I want them back
I want them back
The minds we had
The minds we had
It's not enough to feel the lack
It's not enough to feel the lack
I want them back
I want them back
I want them You're the only friend I need
Sharing beds like little kids
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough
But that will never be enough
You're the only friend I need
Sharing beds like little kids
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough
But that will never be enough All my life
I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do 'Cause I was raised up
To be admired to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh I'm faking glory
Lick my lips toss my hair
And send a smile over
And the stories brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size I was frightened of every little thing
That I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me But I learnt not to want
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause the approval the things that make me go Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size I was frightened of every little thing
That I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me But I learnt not to want
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause the approval the things that make me go Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh You asked if I was feeling it
I'm psycho high
Know you won't remember in the morning
When I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home
But who am I?
Oh how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses We told you this was melodrama
(Oh how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish was melodrama
(Oh how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses) And the terror and the horror
When we wonder why we bother, ooh oh
And the terror and the horror
Gotta wonder why we bother, ooh oh
All the glamour and the trauma
And the fucking melodrama, ooh oh
All the gunfights and the limelights
And the holy sick divine nights, ooh oh
They'll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kissed and killed each other, ooh oh
They'll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other
(Talk about it) We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day yeah
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it then we'll stay
Impress the empress, take a shot now We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are Up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins started to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this If you want we'll help tonight to split his schemes
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smiling but the notes from my admirers
Fill my dashboard just the same We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are Up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning,
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this when we're Up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning,
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this (And everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no one could) I'll let you in on something big
I am not a white teeth teen
I tried to join but never did
The way they are, the way they seem is something else, it's in the blood
Their molars blinking like the lights, in the underpass where we all sit
And do nothing and love it And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could (White teeth teens are out)
And everything works out so good
(I wear the robe like no one could)
White teeth teens are out That slow burn wait while it gets dark,
Bruising the sun, I feel grown up with you in your car
I know it's dumb We've both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue When people are talking, people are talking
When People are talking, people are talking Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone
We're alone All my fake friends and all of their noise
Complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor
And you haven't stopped smoking all night
Maybe the Internet raised us
Or maybe people are jerks When people are talking, people are talking (But not you)
When people are talking, people are talking Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone
We're alone All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone,
We're all alone
We're all alone I know we're not everlasting
We're a train wreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we're all get still
When people are talking, people are talking
Get still When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
We're all alone
We're alone All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, so we're dancing in a world alone
We're all alone
We're all alone When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking
When people are talking, people are talking Let 'em talk We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you?
'Til the veins run red and blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do, let me kill it with you You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave (And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed Now we're wearing long sleeves
And the heating comes on
(You buy me orange juice)
We're getting good at this
Dreams of clean teeth
I can tell that you're tired
But you keep the car on
While you're waiting out front You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave (And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you?
'Til the veins run red and blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do, let me kill it with you (And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed And I like you
And I like you
And I like you (One, two) Baby really hurt me
Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands
Play at romance, we slow dance
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting
Running through the night, but
Every perfect summer's
Eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone They're gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm nineteen and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing I'm alright
It's just another graceless night Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night, 'cause All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway? You asked if I was feeling it
I'm psycho high
Know you won't remember in the morning
When I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home
But who am I?
Oh how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses We told you this was melodrama
(Oh how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish was melodrama

We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offered
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama Today is my birthday, and I'm riding high
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall
Everything I say falls right back into everything I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet Riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
I won't be her, tripping over on stage
Hey, it's all cool
I still like hotels, but I think that'll change
Still like hotels, and my newfound fame
Hey, promise I can stay good
(Everything feels right) I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown
I'm little, but I'm coming for you (chase paper, get it)
I'm little but I'm coming for the title, held by everyone who's up All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah All work and no play
Let me count the bruises
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Lonely on the new shit Set yeah
Yeah Only bad people live to see
Their likeness set in stone Only bad people live to see
Their likeness set in stone
What does that make me? I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah We roll in heavy summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to
And Jamie picks fights but they're weak and short lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in heavy summer like it's shameful to be underneath
The ceiling or a roof, try come out and steal our thunder Now the days are getting cooler, and the burning of our limbs
Doesn't happen quite as bad as the burn is just skin
Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter
Like the movies that we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go I can feel the subtle taste
Of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning
But you come over at night and we practice all the breathing Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
So take it down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
So take it down Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
So take it down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
So take it down I'll pull the trick if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killing you
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic but you never said
We're getting dead and it's the right way Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
So take it down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
So take it down Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
So take it down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
So take it down Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
So take it down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
So take it down Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
So take it down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
So take it down There's nothing I want but money and time
Million dollar bills and a tick tick tick tick
There's nothing more cruel
Than only nine lives
A limit in spite
Will do the trick trick trick trick We can leave the house lead the party let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go There's nothing as fun as coming untied
And running with the kids in the park park park park
There's nothing that hurts like letting you go
Tiger burn eyes in the dark dark dark dark We can leave the house lead the party let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go
It's not about just being out with all our people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know We were down in the hospital
Waiting for you to get well
In the ambulance you're laughing
The real fun was when we were young
Let's go back It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down Skip a hit, don't make a sound
It feels better biting down Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
It feels better biting down Listen to the beats resound
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down Skip a hit, don't make a sound
It feels better biting down Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
It feels better biting down Listen to the beats resound
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
It feels better biting down The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down Skip a hit, don't make a sound
It feels better biting down [Verse 1:]
I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Well you laughed, baby it's okay
It's buzzcut season anyway
(Well you laughed, baby it's okay) [Chorus 1:]
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good [Verse 2:]
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays) [Chorus 2:]
The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good [Post-Chorus:]
And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong but nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make believe, it's hyper-real)
But I live in a hologram with you [Bridge:]
Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us [Chorus 1:]
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good [Post-Chorus]
And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong but nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
Where all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make believe, it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you It's time to let the lost boys take you in It's getting cold out
You let yourself down
So please don't go out
You're looking dead behind the eyes We'll stay at your house
Watch all those late shows on TV...
I like it best when you're in here with me And all the lost boys
We make a picture perfect team
Bruising sidewalks
With all the drumming of our feet
And boy, I promise
We'll never ever let you leave
Never let you leave Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy Easy, easy
You switch the screens over the
Rest of you fools
Easy, oh easy
They poke around until they
Get what they want
Easy, oh easy Oh, easy, easy
Throw the lunch you pay for
Out of sight when it's
Easy, oh easy
Throw the lunch you pay for
Oh easy, easy Easy, easy
Pull out the heart that keeps you
Feeling alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy Bring your own lampshade
Somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending
Can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade
There'll be plenty enough room in jail If being wrong's a crime
I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind
Then I need help here with this feather If being afraid is a crime
We hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line Pound the prairie pavement
Losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work
And never going fishing
Water all around,
I never learned how to swim now If being wrong's a crime
I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind
Then I need help here with this feather If being afraid is a crime
We hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line Bring your own lampshade
Somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending,
Can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade
There'll be plenty enough room in jail If being wrong's a crime
I'm serving forever
If being strong is what you want
Then I need help here with this feather If being afraid is a crime
We hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying
I feel a strange every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship, but
My momma hang and my sister, sit
Its on now, the days are long now
The ups and the sun down
In the twisting morn
If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors
Always changing sides
They were friends of mine Don't hang around as the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when I'm the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a sarlatan
Some imagine freedom
All the rest is predictable
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate
Keep on pulling that rope will break We'll welcome the new age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle till dusk sky
See now the stars burst
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you wanna cry
Precious friend of mine Will I know when it's finally time
This whole life of hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying to be Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion

Every night I go,
Every night I go sneaking out the door.
I lie a little more,
Baby I'm a helpless.
There's somethin' 'bout the night,
And the way it hides all the things I like.
Little black butterflies deep inside me. What would my mamma do?
Uh oh, Uh oh
She know about me and you?
Uh oh, Uh oh
What would my daddy say?
Uh oh, Uh oh
He saw me hurt this way? Uh oh, Uh oh
Why should I feel ashamed?

Yet here we are again,
It's nearly perfect. What would my mamma do?

Pull out the heart that keeps you
Feeling alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar Those great whites, they have big teeth
Oh, they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you, ever, I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it 'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you All those rumors, they have big teeth
Oh, they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you, ever, I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it 'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Yes, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it Just give
me a reason I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fire
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it And our people talk to me, but nothing ever hits
So people talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm going in (ooh) This is the start of how it all ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We rip the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart I dream all year, but they're not the same kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone that ever laid a finger on me
I'm going in (ooh) This is the start of how it all ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We rip the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat 
You ever want something 
that you know you shouldn't have 
The more you know you shouldn't have it, 
The more you want it 
And then one day you get it, 
It's so good too 
But it's just like my girl 
When she's around me 
I just feel so good, so good 
But right now I just feel cold, so cold 
Right down to my bones 
'Cause ooh... 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
It's not warm when she's away 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And she's always gone too long 
Anytime she goes away 

Wonder this time where she's gone 
Wonder if she's gone to stay 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away 

I know, I know, I know, I know, 
I know, know, know, know, know, 
I know, I know, 
Hey I ought to leave 
I ought to leave her alone 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
Only darkness every day 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away


Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay

Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

[Chorus:]
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are

[Bridge:]
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside

[Chorus:]
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
I gotta be where you are


Oooh
Foolish of me, I couldn't see 
The forest for the trees 
You've been so true 
I've been so cruel to you 
Oh, girl please don't leave me

[Chorus:]
If you stay I'll find a way 
To erase the past 
Baby don't leave me 
Girl don't take your love from me 
Oh girl 

What can I say to make you stay 
Baby, don't leave me 
You've been so kind 
It blows my mind to know
Oh girl, I really hurt you 

[Chorus:]
Tell me girl, it's not to late 
And you give me a chance 
To make it up to you 
Don't take your love from me 
Girl don't take your love 
Don't take your love 

[Bridge:]
Girl, if you take your love away from me 
I'm gonna be in misery 
Your love is the strength that I lean upon 
How will I make it when it's gone 
Of all the little things I wanted to say.... 
...I really wanted to do
Girl , this time...
Ooh, oh girl I really mean it 

[Chorus:]
So tell me girl, it's not too late 
And you'll give me a chance 
To make it up to you 
Don't take your love from me 
Don't take your love, no no no no no
Don't take your love
Don't leave me girl 

Don't take your love from me 
Baby, don't take your love from me 
Don't take your love from me 
Oooh, don't take your love from me 
Baby, don't take your love from me


[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share

[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

In despair we'll be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough

[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

Just a little time is all it takes
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
Love is all we need

[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way


Got to be there, got to be there 
In the morning 
When she says hello to the world 
Got to be there, got to be there 
Bring her good times 
And show her that she's my girl 
Oh what a feeling there'll be 
The moment I know she loves me 
'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize 
I need her sharing her world beside me 

So I've got to be there 
Got to be there in the morning 
And welcome her into my world 
And show her that she is my girl 
When she says, "Hello world!" 
I need her sharing the world beside me 

That's why I've got to be there 
Got to be there where love begins 
And that's everywhere she goes 
I've got to be there so she knows 
That when she's with me, she's home 

Got to be there 
Got to be there


He rocks in the tree tops all day long 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 

[Chorus:]
Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin' 
Blow rockin' robin 
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight 

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee 
Every little bird in the tall oak tree 
The wise old owl, the big black crow 
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go 

[Chorus]

Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand 
Told them how to do the bop and it was grand 
They started going steady and bless my soul 
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol 

He rocks in the tree tops all day long 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 

[Chorus]


When this old world gets you down 
When your spirit's on the ground 
Just remember I will always be around 
Just climb on the wings of my love 
I'll take you high on the wings of my love 
When you're feeling all alone 
Like a child who's got no home 
You know you've always got a place where you can go 
Just climb on the wings of my love 

Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees 
As it rushes to the seas darling we'll be just as free 
I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly 
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 

'Til you break those ties that bind 
'Til that day you're really mine 
Anytime you want to leave your world behind 
Just climb on the wings of my love 

I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly 
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 

We've got rainbows yet to find 
And we'll find them all in time 
Girl you know someday we'll even touch the sky 
Just climb on the wings of my love 

Anytime you want to leave your world behind 
I'll take you high on the wings of my love 
Just take my hand and together we'll touch the sky 
Just climb on the wings of my love 
Yes remember I will always be around 
I'll take you high on the wings of my love

Without you darling my life is through 
Come on back


Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tendeness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the lonelyness
Thar was waiting there

[Spoken:]
You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came
Into my heart
You turned and you walked
Just walked away

[Spoken:]
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now

Look at me
See what loving has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

[Spoken:]
My heart cries out for your tuch
But baby, you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh oh my darling, now you're gone
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,
Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone


When you're down and trubled 
And you need some love and care 
And nothin', no nothin' is goin' right 
Just close your eyes and think of me 
And soon I'll be there to brighten up 
Yeah, even your darkest night 
You just call out my name 
And you know, wherever I am 
I'll come a-runnin' 
To see you again 

[Chorus:]
Winter, spring, summer or fall 
All you have to do is call 
And I'll be there, yeah I will 
You've got a friend 

When the sky above you 
Grows dark and full of clouds 
And that old north wind 
He begins to blow 
Here's what you do baby 
Keep your head together 
And call my name out loud 
And soon you'll hear me 
Knockin' at your door 
Oh yes I will, yes I will 
You just call out my name 
And you know, wherever I am 
I'll come a-runnin' 
To see you again 

[Chorus]

Ain't it good to know 
That you've got a friend 
People can be so cold 
They'll hurt you and desert you 
And take your soul if you let them 
Oh, don't let them 

[Chorus:]
Winter, spring, summer or fall 
All you have to do is call 
And I'll be there, yes I will 

You've got a friend, yes you do 
You've got a friend, yes you do 
Right till the end, for you 
Ain't it good to know


Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me) 

Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there) 
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere) 
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go) 

I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"

Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben 
(A friend) 
Like Ben
(Like Ben) 
Like Ben

People... 
('Round and 'round and around...)
People make the world go 'round
('Round and 'round and around...)

Teachers on strike, no more school today
They want more money but the board won't pay
People
Everybody's talkin' 'bout ecology
The air's so polluted that it's hard to breathe
People

[Refrain]
But that's what makes the world go round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young men...
People make the world go round...

Old folks judge you by the clothes you wear
They'd swear you're a hippy if you have long hair
Young politicians fight for poverty
While people still cry for equality

[Refrain]
But that's what makes the world go round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young men...
People make the world go round...

[Instrumental]

But that's what makes the world go round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground young men...
People make the world go round...

Everybody's somebody's fool
The world is the biggest school
As you live, you learn though a torch will burn
Everybody's somebody's fool

You go through life making fools of others
Prentending you're giving them love
But remember sister or brother
You all have to answer to the one u above

It's beautiful to watch love begin
But oh so sad when it ends
As you got through life remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool

It's beautiful to watch love begin
But oh so sad when it ends
As you got through life remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool


I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

And where they go nobody knows

Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share

[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

In despair we'll be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough

[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

Just a little time is all it takes
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
Love is all we need

[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

With A Child's Heart
Go face the worries of the day
With a child's heart
Turn each problem into play
No need to worry no need to fear
Just being alive makes it all so very clear
With a child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart
You've got no reason to frown
Love is as welcome
As a sunny sunny day
No grown-up thoughts
To lead our hearts astray
Take life easy, so easy nice and easy
Like a child so gay and so carefree
The whole world smiles with you
As you go your merry way
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me down


Into each life some rain falls
Then comes the snow
But after the snow
The flowers will grow
Girl when my life got stormy
You stayed for the ride
You stayed my side
You make the sun shine

[Refrain]
I'm up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you

This Humpty Dumpty's lucky
He's had his fall
But after it all
He brushed himself off
Knowing how much you loved me
I made one more try
I reached for the sky
And I made it this time

[Refrain]
I'm up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you


You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine

You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some, some, some, some, day 
My happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine
yeah yeah, all the things you are, are mine
all the things you are, got to be mine
Some day you are, are mine
all the things you are, got to be mine
all the things you are, got to be mine

Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was

Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lam was I, till you came in
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
(Till now) 

Where have I been? 
What lifetime was I in? 
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was 
Till now

Happy, yeah yeah
Happy, oehoe happy

happy oh yeah Happy
[fade out]


They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love

They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go

And then someday they may recall
We were not to young at all

They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not to young at all

E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
It's very easy to say
Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart
Do what you wish, be what you are
What a victorious thrill
Wearing a smile, all of the while
Feeling the world standing still
Watch raindbows glow rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything's in your powers

E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
Full euphoria
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn
Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart
How good to be happy and free
Living the way that you choose
Healthly and clean
Can't understand anyone having the blues
Euphoria never to feel frustration
How great to give love without invitation
Euphoria, euphoria
Long as we love each other
Euphoria, euphoria
Living for one another
Euphoria, euphoria
That's one word for heaven
Euphoria, euphoria
living your live as Heaven


Morning glow, morning glow
Starts to glimmer when you know
Winds of change are set to blow
And sweep this whole land through

Morning glow fill the earth
Come on shine far all you're worth
We'll be present at the birth
Of all faith looking new
Morning glow is long past due

You should have started long ago

Morning glow all days long
For we sing tomorrow's song
Never knew we could be so strong
But now it's very clear
Morning glow is almost here

Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
We should have started long ago

Morning glow all of your life
We can make the new day right
All the bad songs of the night
Will fade into the past
Morning glow is here at last


We've been together for such a long time now
Music, music and me
Don't care wether all our songs rhyme
Now music, music and me

Only know wherever I go
We're as close as two friends can be
There have been others
But never two lovers
Like music, music and me

Grab a song and come along
You can sing your melody
In your mind you will find
A world of sweet harmony

Birds of a feather will fly together
Now music, music and me
Music and me

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong

Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye
There's a card in my hand
Tears fall like rain
I wanna come home again
I want you to... 

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ain't no love in this world
Ain't no love in this world without you

In my search to find myself
I saw your face and nothing else
Every place I go everything I do
I still feel the need for you
Come on and... 

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby

I'm on my way back to you
And I wanna make it up to you
And all the prolems that I caused you
If ti takes my life I'll make it up to you
I just want you to take me, take me
Take me, take me, take me, take me

Take me back, forgive me
Take me back where I belong
If you can, if you can find it
In your heart to forgive me


One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll . . . 

One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day . . . 

One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there

You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day . . . 

One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there


[VERSE 1]
Cinderella, stay awhile
You're the one
That I've been lookin' for
Cinderella, when you smile
All around me sunbeams
Start to fall

Midnight is so near
Please don't disappear
Now that you are here
Stay awhile

[VERSE 2]
Cinderella, I just know
That the magic slipper's
Gonna to fit
Cinderella, do not go
You're my princess

This is love for sure
Love that's sweet and pure
Love that will endure
Stay awhile

[BRIDGE]
When you speak the angels all sing
This is the kind of magic you bring, oh

Cinderella, stay awhile
This is like a fairytale with you
Cinderella, when you smile
All my fairytales are coming true

Well my only fear
Is midnight is so near
Please don't disappear
Stay awhile, oh

I'll plant you a garden
Of laughter and tears
With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years
The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true

[CHORUS]
'cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few

[BRIDGE]
We shall have music
We shal have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time

[VERSE 2]
Then we'll add up the pleasures
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
The cake and the crumbs
How lucky we are to be me and you

[CHORUS]
'cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few
[ad lib to fade]

[Verse 1:]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You're paralyzed

[Chorus:]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Verse 2:]
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
But all the while you hear the creature creepin'up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus:]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting to survive inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge:]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life

[Verse 3:]
They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change the number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
All thru the night I'll save you from the terrors on the screen,
I'll make you see

[Chorus:]
That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare to try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller
Thriller here tonight

[Rap - Vincent Price:]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnite hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighbourhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
Can you dig it?!

[Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo]


They told him, "Don't you ever come around here.
Don't wanna see your face. You better disappear."
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, beat it [4x]

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus 2x]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it

Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

[Chorus 3x]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it, beat it


[1st verse]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

[2nd verse]
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Bridge]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[3rd verse]
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(do think twice.)

[4th verse]
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
She showed a photo of a baby crying
His eyes looked like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby

[Bridge]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, she says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

Looking Out
Across The Night-Time
The City Winks A Sleepless Eye
Hear Her Voice
Shake My Window
Sweet Seducing Sighs

Get Me Out
Into The Night-Time
Four Walls Won't Hold Me Tonight
If This Town

I Like Lovin' This Way

Looking Out
Across The Morning
The City's Heart Begins To Beat
Reaching Out
I Touch Her Shoulder
I'm Dreaming Of The Street

[Chorus]
If They Say -

Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way
If They Say -
Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature
Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way
I Like Livin' This Way

There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady our love will shine (Lighting the night)
Just put your trust in my heart and meet me in paradise (Now is the time)
Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away

So let me keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
Just come into my arms
While the world goes spinnin' by
In the glow of candlelight
I will show you you're the lady in my life

Don't need no fortune or fame
I just want you close to me (There's no mystery)
No time for castles in space
Or livin' in make believe (Don't you just see)

As long as I know you'll be there, girl

So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel alright
And baby through the years gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight that you will always be the lady in my life

Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need you sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl

And I will keep you warm through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And baby through the years even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life

Stay with me, I want you to stay with me
I need you by my side
Don't you go no where

She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing

I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories.

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me.

Don't you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

Going know her way

There's sound of the melody
I got song you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Make my heart keep turn
To the music got to love that filled my mind

All the song to me

If I had a penny for everytime
I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel for everytime
I didn't understand

I'd be the world poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you're willing do

If I had only reach out
I might still be touching you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
(You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you) 

Would get embarrassed for every time
I've moved and make you cry
You get sentimental, and
I would never know the reason why

I hold the world sings
Making for my selfish pride
Is it really over
When I get close to you

I only want to show you
That I'm learning a thing or two
If you want the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to...


Girl you're so together
Together we can make it, all the way
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe, yeah

It's no dreams
But with proof as sweet as you, noo
Apples peaches and cherries
Just won't do, ooh baby

Even the flowers and lollipops
Could never hope to top
The sweetness of your kiss
Can you dig it?

Between a million bucks and you

Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you, 
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh

I found my happiest days, 
When you came to see your grandma in may
I bumped into you by the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now

Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
(Bye, bye) 

Don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh, yeah

When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget, no? 

I'll never forget you
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
(Bye, bye) 

Don't turn around
You might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell

There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?
Darling the days
I had were cold

Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live

But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need

If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna to kill me
Not to be with you 
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too

So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewhere
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me 

Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me... call on me

Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me... call on me


I can't believe that is real
The way that you made me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide
I know it's you honey baby, yeah

That makes the world go round
And it's keeping me here loving you baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby come and take me

Take me by the hand
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me
Oh.. it always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
From love that I cannot hide
You broke my heart into half
I know it's you and me
Baby yeah...


To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame,
Not set, the pace for style

If I can follow through
on, what they gave me as my tools,
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart

I've done all to be done 
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else
(Of without compromise, 
Shall follow the feel of constant care) 

In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man the way
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared that are a shame
To just be called a part of God

For which I have been named
A man and a woman's youngest son
while growing, still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile... 
(Proud)


Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Come on, come on,

On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be...
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth

To hide your hands

Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now A drug and a dream
We lost connection, oh come back to me
So I can feel alive again
Soul and body try to mend It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again, to be in love again, to be in love again Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange

Really loves my company He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well 'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this
Anymore
Uh
Anymore And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door

A murderer

Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it

The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't want to ever leave
Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me how awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I left the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes So shine bright, tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes So shine bright, tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond [Narration]
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed
That someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless; like nothing can save you
And when it's over, and it's gone
You almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good [Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine) We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place We found love in a hopeless place

Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play the key
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, I'm moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go And you can see my heart, beating,
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger) Say a prayer, to yourself
He says, close your eyes
Sometimes it helps
And then I get, a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost And you can see my heart, beating,
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I, ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life And you can see my heart, beating,
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!
I know that I must pass this test
And you can see my heart, beating,
Oh you can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger) I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'

Palm to palm, we were always just that close
Wrist to wrist, toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us? In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me, my California king Eye to eye, cheek to cheek
Side by side, you were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm, dusk to dawn with the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us? In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me, my California king Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me, my California king My California king
My California king In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me, my California king That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No) But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did (But I hate it) You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong (But I hate it) You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (ooh, whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (ooh) And you completely know the power that you have (the power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (one that makes you laugh) Sad, and it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I love you beyond a reason why
And it just ain't right And I hate how much I love you, girl
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go

That's how much I need you (how much I love you)

When we first met, I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
And now I feel like Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause, baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause, baby, you're my disease Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'd do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way than I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
It gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the way you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
'Cause now I feel like Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave

everything is restless in my heart
I hate the way this feels
suddenly I'm scared to be apart.
The days are dark when you're not around
the air is getting hard to breathe.
I wish that you would just put me down
I wish that I could go to sleep. Loving you is suicide
I Don't know should I go or should I stay?
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
But I heard you say you loved me.
That's the part I can't forget
and I wish that you'd come save me
cause' I'm standing over the edge. I should let you go
tell myself the things I need to hear
but my brain is wired wrong.
That's why i'm loving you when you're not here.
Feels like I drown in your every word
and every breath that's in between.
Somehow you got me where it really hurts
And it's killing every part of me. Loving you is suicide.
I don't know should I go or should I stay.
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
But I heard you say you loved me
that's the part I can't forget.
And I wish that you'd come save me boy
cause I'm standing over the edge. loving you is suicide
and my world's about to break
And I... had as much as I can take
and love is a long way down. Loving you is suicide
and it's getting harder everyday.
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
And I'm way past every moment
but I'm still determined to fight
and I know it's taking all my strength
to keep emotion alive.
Loving you is suicide Te amo, te amo, she say's to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra, she takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried Te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go
My soul is awry and without asking why
I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uhh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water, I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried Te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go
My soul is awry and without asking why
I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you Yes we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night
I move under the light because I understand
That we all need love, and I'm not afraid
I feel the love but I don't feel that way Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried Te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go
My soul is awry and without asking why
I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you, I love you Te amo, te amo, don't it mean I love you Yayo, yayo

That's something missing Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Ohhhh what now? I found the one he changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love
But I'm not mugging Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Please tell me
What now? There's no one to call cause I'm just playing games with them all
The more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spent every hour just going through the motions
I cant even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out
What now? Somebody tell me

All my all my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here,
What you need to do is be thankful
For the life you got, you know what I'm sayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
And start being thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life Hey, never mind what haters say
Ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazin' they ungrateful
After all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way
For you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away
Now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege
Homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious
They violate in a major way
I never been a hater
Still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay'
You know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white
It has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway
Even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way
Not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood
And all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience
But they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray
Now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life
Can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life I'm the opposite of moderate
Immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler
And the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit
Impartial to the politics
Articulate
But still'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems
With their record sales just holler TIP
If that don't work and all else fails
Then turn around and follow TIP
I got love for the game
But ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame
And rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin'
Back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know
What you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account
And you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches
'Cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we? You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (Shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it (So live your life) Come Mr. DJ song pon de replay

So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up off sizz' and "I love you"
Is the only thing that's in my mind You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk and still with a full ash tray
With a little bit too much to say Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now A drug and a dream
We lost connection, oh come back to me
So I can feel alive again
Soul and body try to mend It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again, to be in love again, to be in love again Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again, to be in love again, to be in love again Be in love again I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry Did it happen when we first kissed?
Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry How did I get here with you, I'll never know?
I never meant to let it get so, personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

What you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy
Told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, hmm
Don't understand it blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid My new nickname is "You Idiot" (such an idiot)

They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me let go

But you insist on repeatedly trying
To tell me lies

Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
Patron on the brain, ball player in the face
They shake the spot, she's just another case Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever He's staying with a flock of them, oh, yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop its
Getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever We stay moving around, solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone fore
